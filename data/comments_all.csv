It is the only spot in the park where you can see a flock of skimmers fishing together like a bunch of synchronized swimmers in an old movie, and then landing on Caven Point to rest and digest.

My name is Bruce Franco. I am a Bayonne resident, born and raised in Jersey City and a retiree from the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority. I am proud of the work I did at the JCMUA to protect our local waterways. 

Like many visitors to the park, I am an avid fisherman and fish these waters from both land and on my boat for over 50 years. I have major concerns regarding our environment and the proposed remediation that I would like to share with you that I didn’t have the opportunity to do so despite being in attendance last Saturday. 

Protecting the waterways and ecosystem: 

This plan calls for the flooding of the interior of the park after remediation. However, this area is low-lying and prone to flooding. How do we ensure that the chromium cleanup is adequate?

Failure to ensure complete contaminate removal in combination with storm surges would impact the ecosystem and disrupt the migration paths of all the fish here such as Stripe bass, Porgy, American eel, Winter founder, Summer fluke, Blackfish, Oyster Crushers, and believe it or not, Spanish Mackerel. 

Capping as a pertains to future contamination of water from erosion:

Are there any erosion reports, studies or monitoring plans to ensure that capping and then flooding won’t affect the New York New Jersey waterways, wildlife and people's health. While climate is forever changing and continuously impacting our area, producing storms and surges, we have never seen before, are there any projected erosion reports for the next 5, 10, 20 years from now? Without conclusive proof, the DEP maybe creating a wetland environment that is a contaminated timebomb which will endanger wildlife, plant species, fish and people. 

Essentially your plan, if I understand it correctly, is opening a water entrance from the Hudson Bay into LSP. Is there any discussion with the state of New York about these full remediation plans specifically on how flooding over partially remediated capped land turned into wetlands might cause toxic fill to affect the combined New York New Jersey waterways?

Why do we need to lose the land at all:

This is contaminated land and historic fill that we do not have access to. We are not capping and building up on this land? Are there any reports or findings that show we cannot cap and build up? I just would like an honest answer to this question. Is it a cheaper alternative to flood the area rather than build it up? If so, is it possible to seek private investment to offset some of the expenses? 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I really hope someone can answer my questions and consider the potential impact to our environment.

Respectfully

Christopher Franco,,"Subject: People's Park Plan is Best for Our Kids!

Dear NJDEP task force,

My name is Christopher Franco, and I'm a resident of Bayonne. As someone who was born and raised here and makes a modest middle-class income, I know how important good parks were for my brothers and I growing up and now my niece. Sadly, under this proposed plan, recreation is more like an afterthought, if at all. 

I have followed the plans to revitalize LSP and NJDEP plan just doesn't cut it for me. Sure, cleaning up the park is important, but that's just the first step. We need a park with things for our kids to do – places to play basketball, run around, and maybe even learn to swim or kayak! The People's Park plan includes all that and more, with a community center, sports fields, and even a pool.

It's not just the recreation plans themselves but rather the location and ensuring everyone can easily access them through the park. This is also why I was really excited to see the People's Park proposal take this into account.

Right now, too many kids in Jersey City and Bayonne, especially in our neighborhoods, have to play on crowded streets or rundown courts. The People's Park plan would give them a safe and healthy place to be active, which is so important for their development. It would also be a great place for families to spend time together, without having to travel far or spend a lot of money.

I know some folks might be worried about the cost, but I believe this investment will pay off in the long run. Healthy kids become healthy adults, and a vibrant park can bring our community together.

The People's Park plan is the clear choice for middle-class families. I really hope you consider some of their inclusionary ideas for recreation and entertainment. Please, let's give my niece and others the chance to play and grow in a park they deserve.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Peter Franco,,"Subject: Disappointed in Limited Public Participation at Liberty State Park Meeting

Dear NJDEP Commissioners,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the public participation opportunities at the Liberty State Park meeting held last Saturday. For an issue of this magnitude, I was shocked to see such a small room chosen which left more than 100 people outside. I felt the police were rude and did not allow people in the room even after seats became available. While I appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about the park's future, it was disheartening to see that not everyone who attended was able to directly voice their opinions during the meeting. 

A public forum like this is crucial for residents to engage in open dialogue and share their thoughts on a project that will significantly impact our community. Especially with media attention present, limiting public participation restricts the ability for residents to directly express their views to both the decision-makers and the broader public.

Public comments delivered directly at the meeting hold a certain weight that cannot be replicated through individual emails.  The ability to voice concerns and suggestions in front of the decision-makers and alongside other residents fosters a more transparent and accountable process.

I urge the NJDEP to reconsider its approach to public participation in future meetings. A more inclusive format, allowing for extended comment periods or designated Q&A sessions, would ensure that all voices are heard and considered.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Peter Franco

F. Elizabeth Bodman,,"I am most strongly opposed to any use of the land in Liberty State Park which decreases free access for the public.  Any private use that reduces the open space in the park while profiting a private company is exactly what this land should NOT be used for.  Additionally, with the concern of flooding in the area only increasing, any use that reduces the ability of that land to absorb/mitigate water flow is foolish and short sited. Any such proposal clearly runs in opposition to the desires of the immediate residents of the area as well as NJ residents farther afield who count on this free, open space for leisure activities.",ejbodman@gmail.com
Smaranda Grajdieru,,"I do not support the construction of sports facilities on Liberty State Park property. The park is a natural treasure for Jersey City residents as well as a sanctuary for wildlife.

Anita Perala,,"I am writing to express my support for the DEP's plans for the revitalization of Liberty State Park. As a frequent park user and Jersey City resident, I hope the plans will continue to prioritize flood mitigation in order to protect our environment, wildlife, and the adjacent Jersey City communities. Frankly, I was disgusted to learn about the brazen misinformation spread by Mr. Hurley and others regarding wetlands in the park proposals.

I am strongly opposed to privatization of of the park and to proposals for large-scale stadiums or other commercial venues such as those backed by Mr. Fireman and his group, who seem to want to turn a public space into a private profit center.

Regarding the specific proposals for Phase 1B as presented in the image gallery, I have a few comments. I think I said this in previous feedback, but the scenic train depicted in the ""transportation"" and ""circulation"" images seems gimmicky and impractical compared to a (hopefully electric) park shuttle bus. If a park shuttle bus is included, I hope that it will include a stop at the LSP light rail station to facilitate entry into the park and encourage more people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation.

Regarding the lawn to the east of Liberty Science Center, in the Phase 1B concept image, it is labeled as a ""science lawn,"" while in the Commissioner's announcement video, it is labeled as ""playground or dog park proposed."" That space is currently used as an informal dog run by Jersey City residents, being somewhat enclosed and easy to reach on foot from both the Communipaw neighborhood and downtown coming over the Jersey Avenue bridge. I hope the plans find a way to incorporate a spacious dog run in that general area so that dog owners still have a place to bring their dogs to play safely.

In general, I think the Holistic Long-Term Master Plan does an admirable job of addressing the community's need for multiple kinds of active recreation while still providing space for people to relax and simply enjoy the views and waterfront. I hope the task force will not forget the importance of the coastal wetland habitat and fostering an environment that welcomes both local and migratory wildlife. I frequently walk and run in LSP,  and although I haven't gotten there early enough to see the seals, I have seen many birds including herons, ducks, and hawks.

Aidan OReilly,,"So let's see what's happened here. Environmentalists moved the project that became Liberty State Park from a man made disaster to a park that can not only be enjoyed by the people of our nation, but has also contributed to environmental protection of the entire area. That work is not yet completed as witnessed by much of the area being closed due to one form of poisoning or another. Politicians are less concerned with remediating the problems than they are with generating cash flow for developers and political campaigns. Let's, for a minute, give the politicians the benefit of the doubt and say that their intentions are to improve the area, just for a minute now. The type of ""improvements"" they are pushing for are for a small segment of the population, as usual. Perhaps they have too much time on their hands to think that many people have the same amount of time and money as they do so that they can run down to play a round any time of day. Liberty State Park should not be used to appease developers and contributors to political campaigns. Ti should be cleaned up to make it safe and opened to the people of this nation.

Instead you butchered the Park. Now it is a huge empty Plaza.Your Plan destroyed the beauty of the LSP. The birds, the animals are GONE. Amazing 50+ old trees are GONE!!! Do you even comprehend what crime did you commit? It takes decades to get trees like that...  
What you call revitalization I called butcheritalization. What you did it should be criminalized and federal offence of the amazing place.

For the record, I find Paul Fireman’s continuing efforts (directly, through individual surrogates and through proxies such as The People’s Park Foundation) to not only undermine this plan but the will of the people and best interests of Jersey City and the state reprehensible.

What is new in this comment is a report on efforts to suppress comments in support of LSP. First, the in-person meeting was held, not in the large open area of the terminal where other meetings have been held, but in an “auditorium” with very few seats and restricted access.

Michael Tagliabue,,"Once again I'm voicing my opposition to attempts at forcing through a 5000 seat football stadium & 7000 seat commercial concert venue.  I am very much opposed to the increased traffic and noise pollution both would bring.  I'll be furious if the DEP's interior habitats and flood resiliency plans are scrapped for commercial projects.  I definitely DO NOT want ""multi-purpose athletic fields"" in the Northern recreational areas and still only care for a modest bandshell for the park and not a roaring concert venue.  The park needs better public transportation to get to and not projects that will congest LSP with motorized vehicles that take up ample parking space for the same experience they can get going to MetLife.  Any and all parking for LSP should be solely for folks enjoying the natural and communal aspects of the park and not commercial franchise you can get literally anywhere else.  I'm also in opposition to the Phase 2A Southern Athletics hub.  It would be much better suited for conservation educational facilities and community gardens.  I am though in favor of the 2B proposals for an Aquatics Center and parking/internal transit solutions center.

I am additionally concerned that once we cede green space over to other uses, we will never be able to convert it back.

Since time was short, I would like to make clear that while I stand behind the need of active recreation, the land part that was chosen is not ideal. It would be better to have it near Liberty Science Center and the intersection near the Lightrail(s) and the footbridge. 
This would have the added benefit that it would connect better to the proposed active recreation near the harbor. 
This would also give the people who come on foot, by bike or Lightrail better access.

I regularly run or cycle along the water front, in the interior and visit both playgrounds with my son frequently. The views are amazing and the facilities are pretty good. I recognize the need to additional sports facilities but I think the size and scale needs to be carefully considered. It absolutely does not need facilities with large scale seating and a stadium. I would think indoor and outdoor, multi-use surfaces would be the most important thing. 

I am lucky enough to live close to the park so I don't need to drive to visit but I think you need to do everything you can to encourage public transport, cycling and walking. I live on jersey Avenue and the area cannot handle more car traffic. Please think carefully about how you can discourage car use, could you establish park and ride systems with satellite lots outside of the park. Another down side of cars is the amount of space you would need for parking that could be left for open fields and open space. Please incentivize public transport.

Barry Toubin,,"I attended the full meeting on March 2nd and the commentary afterwards.  After reviewing the current plans and the intentions of some of the future plans, I have to say that this notion of ""overbuilding"" is a real shame.  Bringing concerts, venues, etc will take away from what this park really is.  It is a PARK ... not an entertainment venue.  There are plenty of other places in Jersey City to revitalize for that purpose.  Keeping the open space should be the primary objective.  

I also am completely against taking the parking away near the marina.  Yes the marina people need some parking, but more importantly, we need parking at the Park if there are going to be more visitors.  ""Electronic means"" of transportation for people from a far away parking lot is ridiculous.  It will never accomodate people with large coolers for picnics and I am sure it won't run 24/7 for the needs of the marina.  You want to share the marina parking with the public, fine.  But don't take away parking.

I know LSP has been a comfort to me - even before I lived in Jersey City (Journal Square!), I would drive to this park. 

Since public comment is open about what we’d like to see in our parks, I like to advocate for keeping our park mainly intact in a non-damaging way. What is proposed in Phases 1A, 1B and 2 are fantastic. I believe in utilizing the land that is there to add on simple amenities like playgrounds, amphitheaters and small recreational areas is fantastic. There is so much benefit for the local community as well as the area at large.

My main concern, that many constituents have brought up and continue to bring up, is a certain individuals attempt to lobby and develop on this land. Their latest proposed plan is to build a large-scale concert venue and sports arena. As someone who works at a mid-size concert venue (over 3,000+ capacity) in NYC, working with large promoters like Live Nation, Bowery Presents and AEG, I know that this would be a foolish mistake. There is data that supports that the music industry is still suffering post-COVID. The radius clause between Newark’s Prudential Center, the MetLife Stadium, and many NYC venues would cause a lot of conflict and competition and just cause further divestment in the market. Ultimately, there is very little profit to be made and would just be reckless construction on this land.

As for the sports arena, again, there is an issue with the proximity to the MetLife Stadium, Red Bull Arena, Prudential Center and more. What teams would we even get to come here?  
Beyond that, both ideas do not consider infrastructure. Our traffic and public transit systems are already taxed. As a state, we are not prepared for the chaos that will be the World Cup at MetLife. Most of the park requires people to either walk, drive or take the light rail (which has its own issues). While the current plan that I support would increase activity in the park, it accounts for making access improvements but would also not match the caliber of a 3K or 5K+ event.

What is also great about the current plan with it's three phases is that many of these improvements don't destroy the park. Construction will occur, but ultimately, very little and utilize the open space provided to create something for the COMMUNITY. Developers do not care about the community. Jersey City struggles enough with development and issues of gentrification. This park is a FREE communal space and what is proposed in this program would make this a more active, beloved space for the community. 

I’d like to thank you for taking the time and consideration and I will continue to support and advocate for the gem known as LSP.

Thank you,

Katie Benjamin,,"As a community member of downtown Jersey City for 15+ years, I support the existing DEP plan for Phase 1B. All plans for Liberty State Park need to balance athletic fields with open space that is beneficial to resident use. The existing plan provides a variety of sports fields for use, and gives open space for flood control and use for running and walking.

I support athletic fields and facilities in Phase 2 of the plan, particularly along Morris Pesin Road where traffic can appropriately be routed without overwhelming local roads.

I also support eminent domain of the local golf course and nearby storage and commercial facilities, so that we can expand the park for increased resident use.",KBenjamin@gmail.com

Cody Zimmer,,"I am concerned about losing the parking access in front of the docks at the marina. Some of my favorite memories as a child were walking outside of docks and admiring all of the beautiful boats. It would be a shame to see the best marina on the New Jersey side of the lower Hudson fall into disuse because of lack of access.

That might sound dramatic, but easy vehicle access is essential for a marina. We have to bring in sails, haul out garbage, and bring large and heavy equipment to the boats. I don't mind sharing the space in front of the docks and I like that the park is getting some attention and upgrades, but I would hate to see an already existing use of the park get hamstrung so badly, to the point where many people who already use the docks wouldn't be able to use it any more. Leaving the half of the parking spots that are closest to the water is the minimum we would need for the marina.

The proposed alternative uses for the lawn that includes the basketball courts and tennis courts seems like a great solution and better use of the space that would also keep the marina use intact. That would have the benefit of easy trash removal for the marina and the people using the courts. It would also keep easy access for emergency vehicles for medical and fire emergencies at the docks or the courts. Furthermore, it would keep access for disabled people to the marina docks. I know there are currently many people who would have a very difficult or impossible time getting to their boat without such close access through the parking lot being right in front of the docks. It would also keep the larger fields from feeling like they were just jammed into the first available space that would barely contain them.

As for physical quality of the lawn itself for grass ball fields it would be a poor choice for the following reasons. There is significant wind, most commonly coming from the south, because there is nothing stopping the wind from coming in off the mouth of the Hudson. As I type this we are experien in 45 mph gusts with constant wind speeds of 30mph and strong winds are a very common occurrence during all seasons in this location. There is also the concern that soccerballs and footballs would easily go into the canal or hit a boat, and let's not forget that there is commonly an unpleasant smell coming from the canal as well, particularly in the days following a storm that has overwhelmed Jersey City's combined sewer/drainage system.

The fields are also used by many geese, who would leave a lot of goose droppings on any grass field that was constructed there or any turf field that had grass nearby. The ground is also frequently muddy and would need significant upkeep to keep in a usable condition. There are also frequently deer in the lawn, particularly since the clearing from Stage 1 took place. It would not be at all impressive to visitors during the world cup to see how messy any large ball fields located in that spot would be. 

Liberty Landing Marina is the best and largest marina in the area, and it is really the only option for middle class boat owners in this area. It is one of the only marinas on the New Jersey side of the Hudson that doesn't require constant and destructive dredging to keep it viable. It would be a shame to see the last, widely inclusive marina in the area fall into disuse because of hasty planning that removes necessary parking. Please consider these long-term effects and the unsuitableness of this location for grass ball fields when moving forward with the modifications to the Stage 1b planning. I would love to be continue being a part of this wonderful community and to see the marina continue to flourish and add to the vibrancy of Liberty State Park.",zimmerlcc@gmail.com

Paul Furfari,,"I fully agree with the current, proposed DEP plan for Liberty State Park that balances athletic facilities in the Phase1B Northern Area Recreation with an interior of the park that does NOT include commercial enterprises primarily sports stadiums or concert venues.

New Jersey, and particularly Jersey City youth need more green space and athletic fields, and the proposed track/football field, soccer field and baseball field in Phase 1B plan provide the proper amount of fields and provide the rest of the community with access to walking and running trails. Liberty State Park needs balance in its recreation and the development of new fields will increase access without overwhelming the park, or converting it entirely into a series of sports fields that will only be used by limited people. Open space supports flexible use for more state residents and provides the necessary balance to the current 1B plan. 

As a state resident, I am vehemently opposed to giving the park away for commercialization - most prominently stadiums and concert venues that do not support the community and lead to increased traffic. I support improvements to the park in the Phase 2B Holistic Long-Term Master Plan, including building sports facilities along the external facing and Morris Pesin Drive. There is tremendous opportunity to build that facility with access to the highway, which supports state resident use without the burden of increased traffic inside the park. 

I fully support DEP and The State of New Jersey eminent domaining the nearby golf course and storage facilities at the south of the park for increased public use and expansion of the park, which will be a better use of nearby land and increase space for more public use.",paul.furfari@gmail.com
Bronna Butler,,Please create a “NYC Central Park” space for Liberty State Park. Please plant as many trees as possible.  They are beautiful and they will store carbon to assist with global warming.

Anthony Izzo,,"Jersey City residents crave more green space. They desire an escape from the urban environment, a place for recreation, relaxation, and connection with nature.

Instead of prioritizing additional buildings and venues, the focus should be on revitalizing green areas that cater to the community's needs. This could include playgrounds, dog parks, running and biking trails, fishing spots, and spaces for local businesses to come together.

Preserving and protecting the city's natural beauty is crucial.  Large-scale development projects should prioritize areas outside of Jersey City to ensure a balance between economic growth and green space preservation.

Liberty State Park is a valuable asset to the community and should be revitalized in a way that enhances its existing qualities.",Anthony.d.Izzo@gmail.com
Anthony Susco,,"Hello, 

My name is Dancing Tony and I Run Fun in Jersey City. As much as I enjoy hosting shows in Jersey City and love live entertainment, the proposals by The People's Park with multiple venues and other commercial enterprises are not what Liberty State Park should be used for. Liberty State Park revitalization plans are for the good of the public, while The People's Park Foundation is all about privatization without concern for any impact on the ecosystem of the park, and the park's main purpose is to serve the public good for recreation and enjoyment of the natural beauty of the park. State parks are to serve the community for free and should not be developed for commercial interests. 

I am asking that the board stay with the plans submitted by the DEP and not let the park be corrupted by the false narrative of The People's Park and the controlled influence of Paul Fireman's personal and commercial goals. 

 Thank you kindly

Emilie Krueger,,"The plans to add a stadium at Liberty State Park is terrible. The removal of trees along the marina as well as the change to parking access for the people that pay fees to use the marina are also ridiculous. Keeping the green spaces and areas for wetlands is vital to the park.

The public needs access to parks and playgrounds. The idea to bring a stadium to the park is terrible. 

In addition not hearing out the public and their input is insulting.

John Cunningham,,"To privatize LSP would be a mistake for Jersey City and New Jersey. I support efforts to clean up and improve the park so long as 100% of it remains public, un-ticketed and efforts are made to reduce the risk of flooding.",porters.fissure-0d@icloud.com
Tom Paciorkowski,,"The facilities that are built in Liberty State Park should give people a reason to travel miles to come to the park. It makes no sense to duplicate basic park facilities found at all parks across the city. Why would a kid get on a bus and travel many miles to Liberty State Park just to play basketball when he or she can walk a few blocks to a local park near their home? What makes Liberty State Park so spectacular is the things you can't do everywhere else. For example, in the summer, many families travel to Liberty State Park for grilling and picnics because you can't do that at other parks in Jersey City. I dare you to try and find an empty parking spot in Lot 7 when the weather is above 60 degrees. Where else can you go kayaking in Jersey City? And while I can ride my bike in circles at Lincoln Park, I can ride for miles in Liberty State Park without ever trans-versing the same pathway and without worrying about being hit by a car in a city street bike lane. The focus should be on keeping Liberty State Park unique and special.

Second, large sports fields such as baseball fields, football fields, soccer fields, etc. should be available for general public use without permits when organized sporting events are not being played. It would be a travesty to fence off large portions of Liberty State Park for football, baseball, and soccer fields and have those fields closed to the general public. Whenever I'm in Lincoln Park, all those fields are fenced off and locked, and nobody is using them. Why?

Third, there should be a cost/benefit analysis for every proposal. The benefit should focus on the number of people the proposal will serve. For example, it doesn't make sense to spend millions to built something that only 100 people will use. The cost/benefit analysis should focus on the cost per person. And the cost should include not only initial construction, but the cost to maintain.

Fourth, please don't put down artificial turf. I can't help but think of that song that goes, ""they paved paradise and put up a parking lot."" It would be a desecration to tear up the park's large grass fields and pave them over with artificial turf.

Finally, please don't allow any stadiums or concert venues to be built in Liberty State Park. That's a no-brainer!",kayak@blueham.com
Irena Rothaug,,"The first and most important thing when it comes to Liberty State Park is to be mindful of preserving it as an open space that is free and available to the public, and for environmental purposes. As downtown Jersey City is a flood plain, the park provides a vital buffer and sink for rain water and high tides. It provides vital green open spaces for a burgeoning and ever-growing city increasingly hemmed in by high-rise buildings. It is also a vital stopping place and nesting area for wildlife, and a spacious place where the city-bound residents can directly experience the beauty of the natural world they would otherwise be cut off from..

The ideal, then, is to maintain spaces where rainwater and floodwater can be absorbed. Any nonpermeable surfaces like parking lots, skate parks, playgrounds, or paved ball courts should be minimized or designed to minimize the impact of runoff and flooding. There should not be a football stadium, concert venue, or golf course on this vital public land-- it would not only cause additional flooding and destruction of the park, but also cut off free access to the park by the public. Any facilities would need to be carefully designed with plenteous and well-serviced garbage and recycling bins, as the estuary and harbor would end up further polluted by plastic bottles, escaped balls, and other refuse from attendees.

A farmer's market in the train sheds is unfortunately doomed to failure, since it would be located far from anyone's actual living space. Visiting and transporting groceries back to the surrounding city would require a car, which many residents don't have. Craft markets or occasional events such as the art festival would have a better chance of success, but don't require such a large space. A better use of the space would be a landscaped park or the community gardens mentioned in the plan-- that would also open up the area as a breathable space to sink rainwater.

Any facilities created in the park need to be in response to actual demand. Will these facilities actually get used if they are built? Will people use a track-and-field venue that's so far away from schools and other training facilities? Will skateboarders come to a skate park they have to take a bus to reach? These ideas simply aren't practical. These facilities make much more sense embedded in a community, not located far away from those who would use them. They should not be built in the park.

Due to environmental contamination the interior of the park has been fenced off for a long time, which has given local wildlife a place to thrive. This has also created a vital and irreplaceable natural wilderness, a green space filled with the trees, marsh grasses, and vital features so many city residents long to experience. Recreating the place as a walking area with trails and information has the potential to create a treasure for Jersey City and the state of New Jersey akin to the beauty of Central Park in New York.

At all stages, the Friends of Liberty State Park organization should be involved and have a voice in the planning and preservation of the park. These are people who have protected this vital green space and thought long and hard about how it can best be preserved for the future and accessed by the community.",i.rothaug@gmail.com

Julie MacArthur,,"As a member of this community, I love having Liberty State Park in my backyard. With so much new development (high rises, parking structures, etc.) we are seeing a loss of community for corporate gain. However, the Revitalization Plan for LSP looks to be a way to regain some of what we've lost. While I would prefer to see these developments on a smaller scale scattered throughout the various neighborhoods of the City, communal amenities are what we all need and hopefully this revitalization will provide. For example, Hamilton Park has the only two tennis courts  to serve the entirety of downtown Jersey City - this simply does not adequately serve our City's residents and I hope you keep that in mind as this revitalization progresses. 

Overall, I appreciate that Phase 1B utilizes an area of the park that is closest to the residential part of the City that is currently being underutilized for parking. However, my greatest concern is limiting public access to these facilities (and the park overall) to prioritize profits over residents. We deserve open space without cost - this is our home and public access to spaces like this keep communities healthy. If this revitalization moves forward it should only be with FREE ACTIVE RECREATION. 

I'd also like to state there should be NO COMMERCIAL CONCERT VENUE brought into LSP - This is a community area that will only see the negative effects of this, including increased traffic, noise/vibration issues, limiting access to their own local resources.",macarthur.julie1@gmail.com

We should never have allowed the private exclusive golf course.  But once the land is taken, as we have seen, it is gone forever.

Please be careful.  Ask simply who ultimately benefits from any change.  Watch out for clever private entities as they will mask their intent, mask how they compensate those making the decisions.  Gone are the old days of out-right money changing hands; now bribes are done with real estate, boats or RVs, and other means.

First of all thank you for the work you are doing and your effort to make these meetings open to all.  I live in Central NJ but have visited LSP many times and really enjoy the waterfront walk and the Caven Point Beach section when it is open to the public.  I want to echo most of the comments made by the Public.  It's an insult that a number of Task Force members, including Bob Hurley, decided to leave before the public comments.  And I agree with the public speakers that anyone receiving money to be on the task force should be either forced to resign or have the source of the money they receive be made available to the public.

LSP is a State Park.  I think the efforts being made to provide active recreation makes since in the 60 acres identified for this purpose.  I am less enthusiastic about using the grounds adjacent to the marina for this purpose.  Making the park more accessible to the local residents using a combination of walking and biking paths makes sense.  Adding a trolley/shuttle from the existing Light Rail stations makes sense (electrified please).  What should never be added to a public state park are the items being pushed by the Fireman team.  No large sports or music arenas.  No commercial facilities closed to the general public.

And please, make it clear as soon as possible what are the plans for the Caven Point Beach area in Phase 2.  In my mind the area is already a wonderful spot for nature and people who seek out this resource.  I don't think it needs much else.  I understand why it's closed part of the year for bird nesting.  That's fine.  They deserve a place in the park as well.

Lauren Squillante,,"I am concerned with the inherent bias of the Liberty State Park Design Task Force when it comes to the discussion of active recreation, arts, and culture for the interior of the park. Two of the members of the task force, Elnardo Webster, Jr. and Bob Hurley, are on the payroll of Mr. Paul Fireman, who has been attempting to turn Liberty State Park into his own sports development complex for decades. In fact, in the report of the March 2023 meeting, section 5, subsection g, it says, ""During the course of the 2021-2022 LSP-D Task Force discussions, some task force members independently pursued an evaluation of parkwide opportunities for indoor and outdoor recreational development and other features. While this evaluation was conducted outside the auspices of the LSP-D Task Force, the members who privately sponsored the evaluation shared the resulting concepts with the LSP-D Task force members and presented concepts at LSP-D Task force meetings and elsewhere."" Why are members of the task force ""independently pursuing"" evaluations of any kind without the consent of the majority of the task force or the DEP? It's unsurprising that the concepts that were shared with the task force following the ""independent evaluation"" were ""a community center swimming natatorium, four (4) full size basketball courts, two (2) 2,000 seat NHL size hockey rinks, an indoor track, health center, concessions and/or restaurants, and community space; an enhanced waterfront area with kayak launch, community gardens and greenhouses, extensive walkways to explore the park, 7,000 seat open concert and event venue, 5,000 seat open, lighted football/soccer/multi-use complex with fields and stands for spectators, Olympic level open space 400 m 8 lane track and field facility, and a three (3) season open community activity center for use for farmer’s markets, craft fairs and for flex space."" 

I'm not opposed to basketball courts, a community pool, community gardens, walkways, or multipurpose sports fields with stands for spectators. However, why would Olympic size or NHL size stadiums and facilities be necessary in a community park? Is New Jersey planning on hosting the Olympics in Liberty State Park? That's not what the park is for! The park is for public use by the people of the community and for visitors from across the state and nation. Commercial sports and concert venues have no place in a public park. The noise, the traffic, and the exclusivity those venues would produce would be a major detriment to ""the people's park."" It would make the area off limits to those without the connections or economic resources to access the facilities and would certainly mean the end of a ""Liberty State for all.""

I strongly support the DEP's original plan with the inclusion of multipurpose sports fields and playgrounds in the Northern Recreation area. I have stated before that I am not a fan of turning the historic railroad terminal into a glorified art modern art exhibit. I would much prefer if the area was to be conserved and preserved as a historical site and included educational, historical interpretative exhibits. However, as long as the train shed and terminal remain free an dopen to the public, what is done there won't be at odds with the free and public nature of a state park. This is in constrast to the possibility of commercial sports and entertainment development in the park. Again, that is not what a state park is for! 

I commend the DEP for their efforts to preserve the park's environmental integrity and truly hope they will stick strongly to their original plans for free, public active recreation space for the community and extensive rehabilitated green space in the park's interior for the wider community of flora and fauna, which also deserve use of the park along with the people.

Rosana Pedra Nobre,,"As a passionate advocate for environmental stewardship and community well-being, I believe this initiative holds immense promise for our beloved urban oasis that Liberty State Park is. The enhanced ecosystem restoration plan is particularly exciting and critical for the region. By reintroducing tidal marshes, wetlands, meadows, and urban forests, we would not only create breathtaking panoramic hilltops and sweeping harbor/skyline views but also build resilience to flooding and climate change. The flood resiliency design aligns perfectly with the state's commitment to safeguarding New Jerseyans, in this case Liberty State Park, against the increasing threats posed by extreme weather events. The addition of saltmarsh and the enhancement of upland maritime habitats will not only protect against flooding but also foster biodiversity and ecological balance in a nationally recognized estuary of critical importance. And let’s not forget the miles of interconnected paths—more than mere trails, they are pathways to community engagement. Whether walking, running, or cycling, these routes will connect us to nature, history, and each other. They will invite exploration, exercise, and moments of reflection, reinforcing the park’s role as a shared space for all. As we look forward, envisioning Liberty State Park as a model of sustainable urban park design—one that balances active recreation, arts, culture, and environmental stewardship—is invigorating and I urge the task force and the NJDEP to keep Liberty State Park exactly that, a park and not a commercial venue.",rtdasilva88@gmail.com

Lynn Mullins,,"I have been utilizing the open space at Liberty State park for many years, except when there are firework displays. Who wants to wait in that horrendous traffic?  Building one or two huge stadiums that would be used for concerts would create the exact same traffic nightmare.  Not just for people who live quite close to the park, it would affect people driving towards Hudson County and New York City.  Additionally it would create mayhem for light rail passengers. I don't really see how this idea benefits anyone except concert promoters. 

The attempt at seizing Liberty State for Paul Fireman's personal gain is so clearly obvious here.   Because he has money to spread around to influence leglislators, we presently do not  have a protect Liberty State Park act.  For years he has had a posh golf course with promises to give back to the immediate area and he has done nothing.   People use Liberty State Park for walking, birthday parties, playing ball, cycling and enjoying the view, exactly the kind of things a park should be used for.  Please move forward considering the thousands of people who use the free space in LSP and don't have the money to spend on trying to convince people of their interests.  Privatization is not a plus for out of town visitors to LSP or the people of Jersey City.   Privatization of Liberty State Park is not a plus for Jersey City or for NJ.  A few ball fields or other recreation areas that would benefit the local population is acceptable, especially since the administration of Jersey City has done little in that area for public recreation programs.   I understand that no other state parks include recreational fields for local team sports, but Jersey City is more interested in facilitating building apartments for the wealthy instead of children's recreational needs. 

Thank you",troubledreply@hotmail.com
Robert Fretz,,"First, thank you for leading a transparent process to this point. I echo the sentiment from the hearing that 5 million visitors a year wouldn't happen if the park wasn't meeting a significant need in its present form. While there are areas of improvement needed and welcomed, maintaining the flexibility of the space must be paramount in planning. Permanent structures like stadiums and bleachers that can't be utilized in another manner when there are no games should be a non-starter. Every permanent structure lying dormant takes away from the flexibility that has made the park so inviting to millions of visitors every year.

It is extremely important to take a real look at the financial implications of limited use permanent structures as it applies to long term financial health and stability of the park's overall budget. Jersey City has not been able to generate the local demand to keep stadiums, performance venues, or even nationally recognized sports institutions afloat. Those resorting to well documented misinformation about this process are aware of that fact. Without a demonstrated regional or statewide demand, it seems irresponsible to add the financial burden of limited use permanent structures to the park's budget. This is particularly true if those structure's best case use scenarios, on weekends and summer months, will also negatively impact the experience of the millions who visit the park without these structures existing presently.

While I am generally opposed to permanent limited use facilities, even in reclaimed areas, I am very much in favor of a serious revamping of transportation options within the park to avoid paving open space. As someone who has arrived at the park via the light rail pushing a stroller to the waterfront, ridden to Caven Point from the Heights with my daughter, and arrived numerous times in numerous ways for a myriad of reasons, I know getting around the park can be challenging. At a minimum, a shuttle from the light rail station would help bring those who cannot drive or ride in enjoy the open space they may not otherwise be able to get to. 

This is particularly crucial for the southern improvements, which has no public transit option. As someone who has used the park and attended annual events in and adjacent to the park (Fleet Week, PGA, LPGA, etc.), those existing influxes of people already demonstrate the challenges of increased traffic in and around the park during peak times. Anything drawing more people to the park must put not drawing additional cars at the forefront of planning. Also, facilities like the aquatic center need to make sure the community can actually get to them, which as currently proposed would be a significant challenge to the estimated 40% of Jersey City households that lack cars. 

Finally, I have great hope for restoring the piers on the south end and the continued protection of Caven Point. The piers and Caven Point are regular stops, with this year being the first I've seen harbor seals after years of trying. The exposed rebar made me reluctant to take our youngest out to see them, but the nine that were there was spectacular with a zoom lens. In addition, our family and many others we know rely on Caven Point for the chance to ""walk through the woods"" observing birds and various paw prints in our city that otherwise lacks woodland trails.  The trails may not be long, but they can't be replicated elsewhere in the city, particularly ending at a great spot for a picnic and throw shells into the water.

Jacqueline O'Brien,,"Dear DEP Task Force, 
I attended the recent public meeting in LSP on the topic of revitalization and was dismayed to observe the members of the ironically-named “People’s Park Foundation” depart BEFORE the public comments on the agenda even began.  These people, who have deservedly earned their excellent reputations in JC community athletics, seem all too willing to sully and sacrifice their good names in support of a billionaire who cares for nothing except the revenue he can generate from a vulnerable, natural resource in our midst.  

What made such a sight even more upsetting is that these folks departed shortly after two of the members suggested that an “executive session” be held. 

It is a slap in the face to the many tireless, working-class, hearts-in-the-right-place folks who unselfishly dedicate their time and energy to preserving a rare natural gem in Jersey City’s crown for EVERYONE, not just for cronies of billionaire.  The members of the PPF seek to exploit and replace this natural urban oasis with a synthetic, pollution-and-traffic generating commercial monster.  That’s it.

Destroying what is truly the last natural frontier on this side of the Hudson is not the answer.   There ARE other options for creating a viable venue for the sorely-needed athletic resources for our youth.  It is the City’s responsibility to identify and allocate the necessary lands to pursue such a virtuous goal. 

The DEP must seek to uphold the “P” in its name.  Otherwise, it should consider changing the acronym to “DEE,” with the last “e” standing for “exploitation” and/or “extermination.”

Thank you for your consideration.  It is truly my fervent hope that this task force uphold its original plans for LSP (i. e.  Interior habitats plan, a flood resiliency plan with wetlands, open space and miles of paths).

We need to think about the long-term affects of climate change in all phases.",hongmba@aol.com
Eileen Ferara,,"Phase 1B - It is important for the recreation areas to be accessible to all. Is there a plan for use of the fields by rec. teams/local schools, open time for pick up games? How about transporting groups to use the fields? I know that there are some local places where the fields are locked up and sit empty for most of the time, making the recreation space only available to a few, so it is important to have the field managed. 

Phase 2 - Track and field, skatepark and a community pool all sound great - same comments as far as accessibility to maximize use. Having a small concession (like many of the swim areas at State Park Lakes) would be good. Hopefully there will still be lots of open space for picnics and grilling. Also, I think it is very important to leave wild space with trails for the flora and fauna, and preserve Caven Point for wildlife habitat and education programs by the park rangers. 

It was discouraging to see such a large swath of the park razed of most trees and plants across from the Science Center. I do hope that this means there are remediation and plantings scheduled for this year, otherwise, it is likely to come back with a lot of the phragmites and other weed species, and will have to torn up/disrupted again.

Erik Hartten,,"To whom it may concern,

Hereby this comment, I wish to express my strong support for the current effort to preserve and expand the open space element of the current design of Liberty State Park's (LSP) planned revitalization and my firm opposition to any and all attempts to monetize what is a uniquely precious public good in the name of private commercial recreation and entertainment. 

LSP is the crown jewel in the state's public park system. It provides all New Jerseyans and visitors to our great state both breathtaking views and ""breath catching"" respite from one of the most densely populated urban environments in the country, if not the world. I can think of no other place where one can reach out and almost touch the Statue of Liberty and the New York City skyline, and simultaneously have close encounters with a four-point buck and a herd of does, furtively fastidious muskrats, the soulful calls of Mourning Doves and chatty flocks of migrating Brant Geese. This spectacular intersection of our manmade and natural worlds is one that must be cherished and augmented, not compromised to make room for more conventional activities, which, while they have an important role to play in our community, it is certainly not one that should be inside the boundaries of this fragile parkland. 

I am already dismayed by the heavy bumper-to-bumper traffic that often clogs park roads on weekends and holidays. The introduction of yet more traffic-drawing venues threatens to turn this park into a just another one of our myriad parking lots. While I am all for dedicating a reasonable amount of park space to infrastructure for organized, non-commercial forms of recreation, culture and community education, such as sports, music, history, public art, nature walks, community gardens, etc., this infrastructure should serve the long-term health of the park's natural capital, not short-term monetary gains. 

The park's revitalization is an historic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for today's generation to invest in something truly great that will generate enormous public benefit for generations to come. 

Let's please not squander it! 

Sincerely,
Erik Hartten",thor@hartten.com
Lawrence Ciarallo,,"Good Afternoon,

I am opposed to any commercial venue plans being promoted by Paul Fireman and his paid surrogates on the task force. I firmly support the initial plan put forth by the DEP to continue the remediation of all interior acreage and the development of vital natural habitats in addition to the passive in active recreation in the remaining areas of the park.  

I strongly oppose task force meetings taking place behind closed doors. Liberty State Park belongs to the people and all decisions made about its future should include the public and allow robust debate and input as to how the park can best serve the people of Jersey City, New Jersey and beyond.

William Nierstedt,,"My family - both my mother's and my father's -is from Jersey City.  My mother used to take us on the old CRR or Suburban (I think) bus line to Johnson Avenue in Jersey City to catch another bus over to Park Street where my grandparents lived.  I remember how busy the CRR ferry terminal was with NY bound workers getting off the train and walking through the terminal to catch the ferry.  And I remember -even as a kid - the lack of maintenance in the industrial area that surrounded the wooden shack where we would catch the bus.  The 'roads' the bus traveled on in what the Liberty State Park area is today were dirt, gravel, and after rains, puddle strewn.  I don't know if these trips had some influence on me becoming a licensed professional planner, but they might have.  I must have thought, 'Wow, can't NJ do better than this deplorable area directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan'?

I am writing this comment because finally, NJ actually is trying to do something in this area... something that would benefit ALL residents of Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey, and given how many people come to Liberty State Park to visit Ellis Island and the Statue of liberty, ALL Americans.  ALL visitors would be able to see and visit this beautiful public park that the NJDEP is designing for the remaining 'undeveloped' acres of the total park area.  That is as soon as the NJDEP and we members of the public can stop selfish billionaire Paul Firestone and misguided Bob Hurley from advancing their ridiculous, out of character, misplaced Sports and Entertainment Complex plan with its exclusionary traffic-jam-causing, admission-fee 5000 seat football stadium & 7000 seat commercial concert venue.  Don't we have enough concrete and pavement in Jersey City already?  Don't the 280,000 Jersey City residents need open space more than they need more air polluting vehicles coming into their backyard?  

I beg you to dismiss this for private profit driven commercial venue, and promote, approve, make happen the NJDEP's science-based open space plan with spectacular Interior habitats for the native wildlife who currently have such a hard time finding adequate habitat in our people populated NY/NJ region, a flood resiliency plan with wetlands, playgrounds, active recreation areas, open space and miles of paths for all New Jersey - but mostly under provided Jersey City - residents to visit, play in and enjoy with their children and grandchildren.

Natural land and open space are scarce in our State of NJ & especially in the vicinity of Jersey City. 
The Governor, Politicians, and Private Groups should NOT be allowed to deface them and decrease the amount that still  exists in any way.

LSP, with its UNIQUE LOCATION, has been and should remain a Natural Parkland with its acreage of open and natural land. It has always been a destination for local City people and for visitors from all over NJ & the World who come to enjoy the open spaces and views of the  Hudson River, NYC & the Statue of Liberty.
  
Elected officials should not be considering to allow any private development of any part of the area which would deface the existing parkland and affect wildlife in their life cycles, the natural open spaces, and the fine views from the parkland, and add to traffic congestion & pollution in the Jersey City area.

Matthew Gulyas,,"As a new citizen to Jersey City, I feel that the utilization of a park meant for all designed for only a few is a terrible plan. The wildlife refuge within the park is important for the biodiversity of the city and the green space allows for absorption of any water should the area flood. The park acts a natural barrier also naturally housing deer and migrant bird species which are important for urban people like myself to interact with nature and know that such nature exists within the boundaries of a heavily urbanized region. Also, I have seen in others areas, the destruction of natural wildlife areas will never get rid of wildlife at all and the park will continue to utilized by animals no matter what. The proposed stadiums and concert venues will need high maintenance to even maintain them and so the cost to do will continuously rise over time due to excrement and waste from animals over time. These projects would lose money in the long run due to these costs. The park should be an open space with trails throughout the wildlife area and along the water front. The terminal can renovated to host community events and teach urban dwellers around the environment and educate others amount watercraft and such sports. The terminal can also serve as a marketplace for things such as farmers markets and full restoration would preserve the history of the park. The uses of public land for private purposes is symptomatic of misuse of city owned land that is meant for interactions with nature and a healthy lifestyle. Any construction of stadiums and other places for private use take away the value of the land from the public and any additional parking would destroy a park that is beloved by all and treasured by the citizens of Jersey City. It is for these reasons that I oppose the new plans by the newly appointed task force to benefit personally from the construction of stadiums and concert venues that would see money pass in their hands and not to the local government for the usage to provide services to citizens who need them the most. A park is something that, while being seen a waste of space to property developers, is treasured and used by citizens in an urbanized area to get away from the hustle and bustle of life and relax in the calm surroundings of nature.

Kerry Barringer,,"The Phase 2 plan does not indicate what is to be done with Caven Point, even though it is marked as being part of that phase.  Any feedback is incomplete until any plans or changes for that area are included.

I do not want the Recreation, Arts, and Culture facilities outlined in Phase 1B or most of the athletic facilities in the Long-term master plan (Phase 2) planned for Liberty State Park.  I think that they would ruin the park; in part, because they would take space away from the thousands of people who regularly already use the park for family reunions, picnics, exercise, and passive recreation.  More importantly, the staffing, upkeep, maintenance, and repair of these facilities would create a large expense, drawing money away from other parks, and creating a huge draw on state and DEP funds.  Money may be available short-term, but facilities like these would require a long-term commitment to a high level of funding.

The DEP has shown that it can manage its funds responsibly and balance the needs of people throughout the state, but funding comes through the legislature and there is no indication of how the legislature will fund the facilities outlined here long-term.  Long term funding will be a necessity.

We have nearby stadiums, entertainment venues, community centers, and athletic facilities that, even when they are more conveniently located than those proposed here, are already underused, underfunded, and in need of maintenance.   Adding more in Liberty State Park will not make the Park better and will not help improve the region.

If any area could be improved, it would be the areas now designated for the 'Community Center' and portion of the 2B near the intersection of Morris Pesin Blvd. and Burma Road.  As you are using it, the 'Community Center' too ambiguous and its use needs to be clarified.  The Burma Road site might be best used as an administrative center as the planned facilities will require a much expanded staff for maintenance, administration, and especially security.",kerrybarringer@gmail.com

The initial phases are TOO BIG.  Scale it back.  We don’t need to sign on for the long term costs associated with maintaining facilities that will go unused.

The community center is too far from any school or neighborhood where kids are in need.  We need the community center in Jersey City proper, not in a flood plain.

Now we have people that care nothing for the park, trying to do anything they can to secure a land grab for their golf course. It is sad, this isn't at all about benefitting Jersey City natives, it is about make sure the elite have a place to golf. Continue to improve the park for people and wildlife, it is an amazing place for all to enjoy!! Hands off our park Fireman and Hurley!!",Justacaver@msn.com
Matthew Byrne,,"Thank you in advance for considering my comments.  I have been a tenant at liberty landing marina for about 26 years and currently have a boat on F dock.  I cannot over emphasize the importance of keeping close and adequate parking for marina tenants.  With 520 slips, it is a fair estimate that the marina serves well in excess of 1000 people.  Many access their boats year round and at all hours of the day.  Close parking is critical to enable tenants to bring supplies (such as food, beverages, ice, boat parts, gasoline, propane, etc.) to their boats.  Also, many tenants are elderly, very young, and disabled.  Any shuttle vehicle used to bring tenants from remote parking will be inadequate as it will certainly not run 24x7x365 and allow hazardous supplies (such gasoline, propane, marine chemicals, flares, etc.).  Eliminating parking will kill the marina.  LLM is one of the most expensive marinas in the area.  If parking is removed or significantly reduced, boaters will simply move their boats elsewhere.  This will not only harm the marina's business but will also harm Liberty House and Maritime Parc, which receive a lot of business from the marina tenants.  On a nice weekend day during the summer, the parking lot is completely full.  As such, even reducing the number of parking spots by a small amount will not work.  In fact, the current parking would not even support users of the proposed ball fields who will need to bring supplies such as bats, balls, mits, bases, coolers, etc.  The current parking lots are also home to dumpsters used by marina tenants. On any given Sunday evening during the Summer, these dumpsters are full to the top.  Removing the dumpsters, reducing their number, or making them remote will simply result in litter in the park.  People will pile garbage in the dock gate houses and that garbage will be blown by the wind into the park and water.  It should also be noted that if baseballs hit boats, the costs for damages could be extremely high.  Many boats in the marina are worth millions of dollars.  A custom window for such a vessel could cost a fortune to replace.  Traffic on Audrey Zapp Drive is already horrible on a Summer weekend.  Please consider how badly this will increase when ball field users all arrive and leave at around the same time.  Finally, of all the proposals for a large ball field, the one with a single field and track centered on the grass could work provided that large parking areas are also provided on each side of it.  These areas should have the same number of spots as the current lot plus spots for ballfield users.  Thank you.",matttbyrne@usa.net
Johanna Seppalainen,,"1B: We lack swimming pools in Jersey City. There is only one public all year round swimming pool at Pershing Field, and it is not a very good option. During the summer, a lot of people swim at the Lafayette Swimming pool, showing that there is a clear need for this type of exercise in our city. Hence, I would love to see an all year round, indoor swimming pool for the public in the Northern Area Recreation.

Keep it natural, let the wildlife remain. Jersey City has more than enough development throughout the city. LSP is a unique site and if any of the natural habitat is lost, it will be lost forever. Develop and utilize public transport to help those without cars to access the park. So many park users cannot afford to go on vacations or take trips. This park is for many, our only way to be in a natural setting. We don't need another or bigger golf course, we don't need another concert stadium. We do need Liberty State Park's natural and historical setting, a place to see birds, rabbits, and other wildlife.

Lee Widman,,"Northern Athletics Hub within the Liberty State Park Revitalization Program:

Ecological Impact: The construction of the Athletics Hub will significantly alter the existing ecosystem. We must carefully assess the impact on local flora and fauna. Are there plans to mitigate disruption to wildlife habitats and native plant species? This will  compromising the park’s ecological balance.
Loss of Green Space: The Athletics Hub may consume a substantial portion of green space. While active recreation facilities are essential, we should question whether the trade-off is worth it. Can we achieve the same goals without sacrificing valuable natural areas?
Noise and Aesthetics: Sports facilities tend to generate noise—cheering crowds, amplified announcements, and athletic events. How will this affect the park’s tranquility? Additionally, the visual impact of large structures should be considered. Will the hub blend harmoniously with the park’s surroundings?
Community Engagement: Were local residents actively involved in the decision-making process? Community input is crucial to ensure that the hub aligns with the needs and desires of Jersey City residents. Transparent communication and genuine engagement are vital.
Maintenance Costs: Beyond construction, ongoing maintenance costs for the Athletics Hub must be evaluated. Will taxpayers bear the burden, or are there sustainable funding mechanisms? We don’t want a scenario where the hub becomes a financial strain on the park’s overall budget.
Alternative Locations: Could alternative locations outside the park serve as better sites for the Athletics Hub? Balancing recreational needs with environmental preservation might lead us to explore other options.
In summary, while the Athletics Hub aims to enhance active recreation, we must tread carefully. A holistic approach that considers ecological impact, community involvement, and long-term sustainability is essential. Let’s ensure that Liberty State Park remains a cherished green oasis for generations to come. 🌿🏟️",leewidman@gmail.com

Jessica Jamroz,,"Dear Design Task Force,

I am the memorial designer behind Empty Sky: New Jersey's Empty Sky Memorial in Liberty State Park -- the state's official monument of 9/11 remembrance. It is a result of a design competition that I won in 2004 and it is an incomplete work of art. The Empty Sky Memorial needs to be repaired, restored, and completed and should be prior to 2026 -- the 25th anniversary of 9/11, the 50th anniversary of Liberty State Park, and when the World Cup hits New Jersey.


Items to resolve at the Empty Sky Memorial include:  

•	Integrate TRIBUTE to 9/11 responders and survivors, inc those victims succumbing to 9-11 related illness due to the attacks (this is NOT an ""addition"" to the original 2004 memorial design or State request of 9/11 remembrance -- any suggestion otherwise is materially false. Happy to substantiate).
•	Add NJ 9/11/01 victim names currently missing on the memorial walls 
•	Restore 65 autumn weeping cherry TREES (they were killed due to being left in drought conditions and not provided water -- there is an irrigation system embedded in the memorial mound).
•	Restore broken LIGHTING at base of memorial walls to illuminate victims’ names as originally designed
•	Modernize tech (inc QR code) of the DIRECTORY KIOSKS so finding a name is always possible
•	Restore memorial PLAZA where stainless steel ACCESSORIES have been stripped away and replaced with plastic
•	Memorial Preservation Manual (with protocols for things like what to do to add a name).
•	Include an accessible educational component -- including languages other than english. 5+ million international visitors visit the memorial every year, it is a key landmark on the Federal National 9/11 Memorial Trail, the stop before (or after) the National 9/11 memorial and there is no educational component currently at Empty Sky describing its meaning.

Thank you.

Right now it seems that project is too much for a place called ""state park"". Lot 11 should be a green space - this boat parking is an eye soar for years, baseball field is absolutely not appropriate for that park, there should be trail for walking and for jogging, some small fields for tennis, basketball or volleyball are also good. Liberty State Park should not become sport arena, but a place to rest, connect with nature - so more native gardens would be appreciated, more animals/birds observations points.

Recreation areas are currently absent and the proposed solutions seem to cover some of the most common activities.

In general the areas north of Audrey Zapp Dr seem to be disconnected from the rest of the park.

There is no reason to take away the only green space that we have to exercise in and enjoy the outdoors.

Daniel Chall,,"When I saw the ""people's park"" rendering a while back, it seemed jam-packed with structures that would be a boon to developers and not to the community, or to the environment. I thought their rendering was satire!  Responsiveness to the community is a great idea, but don't give away this valuable public land to fill the pockets of billionaires. We don't need a huge stadium or a big concert venue.  We don't need anything like a light rail to get around the park. A ""central park for passive outdoor recreation, flexible space for community sports, and critical habitat restoration and flood mitigation"" sounds like a no-brainer. I'd be devastated if Caven Point were taken over to provide a more convenient location of three golf holes to be enjoyed only by the very rich. (That parcel of land isn't earning financial profits, and that makes it a desirable land grab. But the land still has immense value in its current use. Where else can migratory birds find such a habitat? Imagine if Liberty National were to buy out a similar-sized parcel in the neighborhood, at Port Liberte'--the cost would be prohibitive. The location is inherently invaluable. That's the magnitude of the land grab being sought in Liberty National's ""vision"" ($$$) for Caven Point.",danchall@gmail.com

It is regrettable that the Park’s status largely has been uncertain over these decades through a combination of political fecklessness and entrepreneurial greed.

Henry Pullin,,"I am 38 years old and was born and raised in Jersey City. I attended summer camp at Camp Liberty for many years, from an early age until I basically aged out. I feel like I know this city and Liberty State Park well. Last Sunday, the day after the ""Task Force Meeting"" and public comment session, I took my parents and some family members who were visiting from out of town to Liberty State Park for a walk. We got the full experience of what Liberty State Park has to offer. Along the Hudson River, we saw the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, and the Skylines and bridges of NYC. As we walked along the paths we saw the lawns, playgrounds, memorials, historic sites, remnant sandy beaches, wetland areas, and forested uplands throughout the park. This was my cousins' first time in Jersey City, they were amazed by what Liberty State Park has to offer. They were literally daydreaming out loud about all of the activities they could engage in at Liberty State Park. There were also so many other people in the park when we were there, people that appeared to be from a huge variety of different backgrounds. Many people sounded like they were from other countries based on their conversations and the languages they spoke. People were strolling, riding bikes, playing sports, observing nature, barbecuing, playing on playgrounds, lounging in hammocks, sitting and observing the scenery, and engaging in countless other activities. All these people appeared to be enjoying themselves very much and they all, in their own way, appeared to be connecting with the same nature, history, and culture that my family and I were connecting with. Liberty State Park has always offered visitors access to resources that are extremely difficult to find in the middle of a dense urban area, and based on the number of visitors, the activities they were engaging in, and the spirits in the park last Sunday, it is clear that Liberty State Park, in its current state, is a wildly successful park.

Based on my experience last Sunday I would like to update my public comment. I initially stated that there may be some room for non-commercial sports fields, but I really don't think there is space in the park. At first glance or on an aerial image it may appear like there is space to spare in Liberty State Park but between parking and the field itself sports fields would use up precious park space quickly. Sports fields also severely limit the types of activities people can engage in on the land where they are located. Basically, people are only able to engage in the sport that the field is designed for. Additionally, sports fields are only used during select seasons, at limited hours, and usually require permits to use. To add to the point about limited space in the park, last Sunday, when I visited the park, it was an exceptionally warm and beautiful day after a long winter, the weather probably explains the massive amount of people in the park that day, but this park is a very popular destination year-round. When we were at the park it was very difficult to find parking and when we left it took a very long time to exit the park, traffic was backed up well into the city streets. Adding fields that attract large amounts of attendees, buses, etc. will only further exacerbate this issue. Doing so could potentially make the traffic much worse and this would be very detrimental to the park. There may be some opportunity for smaller courts intended for active recreation but they should be located near existing parking and not be built at the expense of natural areas (Brooklyn Bridge Park features an excellent example of a concentrated active recreation area). For-profit operations, such as sports arenas or other types of venues, should absolutely not be constructed in the park. Also, on a more general level, I would like to echo some of the comments I heard during the public comments session. State parks are designed to protect areas of natural or historic significance, they are not obligated to provide active recreation opportunities to a city, in this case, that is Jersey City or Hudson County's responsibility. The NJDEP's plans to improve the interior of the park, such as the constructed freshwater and saltwater wetlands and other habitats are truly visionary and sustainable. These improvements are in line with the spirit of the park and they expand and enhance successful elements of the park. This is the direction we should be moving with the park.

I would also like to comment on the elephant in the room. The Liberty State Park ""Task Force"" was clearly created through a billionaire's lobbying efforts. This billionaire has also essentially bought off members of the task force as well as other select community leaders through lobbying and ""donations"" to nonprofits. The task force is clearly a proxy group set up to push the goals of the billionaire. This same billionaire has been trying to make land grabs in the park to expand the golf course he owns that is adjacent to the park for years. There is no mistaking that what the park is going through now is an effort by a billionaire to derail well-planned DEP improvements to the park. The billionaire's motivations are not entirely clear but he is likely doing this in an effort to eventually expand his golf course, work his way into some potential business opportunity he sees in the park, simply out of spite, or some combination of these motivations. Whatever his motivations, at this point, there is no reason he shouldn't think he can't achieve his goals, he has already created a government-sanctioned ""Task Force"" to push his agenda and he has brought much of the park planning to a screeching halt and back to square one. Additionally, he is pushing his agenda through the most despicable of ways. By sprinkling in vague accusations of the park not being accessible to some neighborhoods and not accommodating certain types of uses, while actually working to derail the park improvement process to eventually achieve his own personal and financial goals, the billionaire is opportunistically taking advantage of, corrupting, and undermining truly virtuous social justice movements. While there are some legitimate access issues at Liberty State Park, such as difficult access to the park from underserved neighborhoods, this is something the DEP is on working to resolve. The billionaire who has been trying to take park land away from the public for years did not work so hard to raise issues of access, this was done in an effort to create confusion and opportunities for him to achieve his goals. We all know this, I would just like to say that the behavior of this billionaire should not be catered to.

Lastly, many of the amenities, outside of large-scale for-profit stadiums and public sports fields, that task force members and pro-active recreation public commenters expressed concern over the park lacking, already exist in the park. There are heavily used playgrounds and Camp Liberty provides safe, affordable daycare and programming during the summer months. This is not to say that these offerings can't be expanded on, it should just be recognized that they exist already.

In summary: 
- The park is already well-used and successful
- State parks are not required to provide active recreation, active recreation is the city's responsibility
- There is not enough space in the park to develop sports fields (even after areas that are closed to the public are opened)
- Constructing sports fields would be detrimental to wildly successful park elements and create bad traffic congestion
- Improvements should only expand on what is successful in the park already (access to nature and history)
- The personal agenda of a billionaire should never be catered to on public land

The State should act to preserve the environment that makes the Garden State beautiful and safe. Laying down a large swath of plastic alongside the water is irresponsible. That the DEP would allow it is unfathomable.

The citizens of the state should have access to open, natural and safe recreational spaces. There is no denying that. The DEP should act to assure that this is the case. The Design Task Force must create a plan that does not involve covering the earth with hundreds of thousands, if not hundreds of millions of pounds of chemical laden plastic. This should not happen anywhere in the state, especially alongside a waterway.

Does the Design Task Force know how many artificial turf fields are in NJ now? Does the Design Task Force know how many artificial turf fields are being planned in BOE's and municipalities across the state? Does the Design Task Force know all the chemicals that are used to produce the plastic in artificial turf? Does the Design Task Force know how much of the chemicals and plastic will leach into the surrounding waterways? Does the Design Task Force know how many humans, flora and fauna will be adversely affected by the chemicals in artificial turf. These answers are not fully knowable - the research is incomplete.

Mark Uriu,,"Liberty State Park presents a unique opportunity to create a vast park of naturalized wetland, public recreation and athletic facilities on the last large undeveloped tract on NY Harbor. It will provide the urban citizens of this region free access to nature, open space and recreation. It has been proven repeatedly thru history how access to natural settings vastly improves the quality of life in a city, particularly for the folk who don’t have the easy means to get to the country.  Calvert and Vaux, creators of many great urban parks, are rightly held in high esteem.  Commercial concert and sports venues are much better, more interesting and more accessible when they are integrated into an urban street matrix. To place them in Liberty State Park with their requisite parking lots and built up facilities, would be squandering this region’s last great opportunity to create something really special. 

To limit public access to this huge resource through privatization, whether it be to a members only golf course or for a pay to enter sports/concert venue is just plain wrong. There are much more appropriate places for that kind of private enterprise. 

Those who characterize the climate change resiliency features of a naturalized park as “flooding” are factually incorrect and have learned nothing from Superstorm Sandy. It does beg the question, what is motivating this cynical manipulation of facts and why are some of our politicians going along with it? 

The bottom line is that Liberty State Park is uniquely suitable for development into naturalized parkland and low density athletic facilities and not into higher density entertainment venues.

While I support the idea of an athletics hub near/in the interior, the idea of sports fields and more in the norhtern portion seems like overkill.  The original plan-- with three permanent fields plus beach, etc-- felt like clutter.  I am happy to see more flexibility in recent designs, fewer fields, etc.  Let's keep the sports complex mostly in the southern portion and minimize development of the north.",stevekrinsky@comcast.net
Jo Sippie-Gora,,"The Liberty State Park location is precious, one of the last public spaces that exist in this dense part of our state. I entreat you to resist the privatization and commercialization of this unique natural resource.

Brian Goldin,,"I’m a long-time boater in the marina and as representative of the community with some of the most regular access to the park, we understand the importance of maintaining and promoting access to the water. Our collective efforts have brought a wide range of activities to the park, enriching the experiences of visitors and residents alike.

As tenants of the marina, we represent a vibrant community comprising approximately over 500 boats, spanning nearly the entire length of the Morris Canal. Beyond ourselves and neighboring tenants, we also serve as a gateway for a steady stream of visiting recreational boaters, jet skiers, sailing clubs, weekly sailboat racing enthusiasts, fishermen, and numerous small and large charter boats. Our marina provides countless opportunities for residents and tourists alike to access the water and enjoy various aquatic activities.

We are deeply concerned about the proposed changes that could potentially have negative impacts on our community. It is crucial that any revitalization plans take into account the diverse needs and activities facilitated by the marina, ensuring continued access to the water and preserving the unique character of our waterfront environment.

Vehicle Access and Parking: The availability of convenient vehicle access to the marina and well-designed parking facilities is not a luxury but a necessity to ensure the marina's continued functionality and appeal. Adequate parking not only serves the needs of boaters and visitors but also supports the provisioning, servicing, and repair of boats, activities that require frequent trips to parking areas where heavy equipment, supplies, tools and other items need to and from both personal and service vehicles.

Waste Management: Efficient waste management services in the marina area are indispensable to prevent environmental pollution and safeguard the integrity of both the park and its surrounding water bodies. Currently the marina has a large dumpster next to each dock that is often filled to capacity and The current plan's disregard for proper waste disposal provisions raises grave concerns about potential litter and hazardous waste contaminating our water, endangering aquatic life and ecosystems. Adequate vehicle access and robust waste management are fundamental aspects of environmental stewardship, directly aligning with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's mission to protect our state's environment.

User Experience and Economic Development: A well-maintained marina, complemented by seamless vehicle access and essential services, is pivotal for enhancing the overall user experience. Such improvements attract more visitors, fostering positive economic and community benefits. Local businesses, including restaurants, shops, and service providers, benefit from a thriving marina to flourish and contribute to our community's prosperity.

Emergency Services Access: Furthermore, the proposed plan glaringly neglects the critical need for easy access by emergency services, including police, fire, and ambulances, to the marina and its boat slips. In times of emergencies or water-related accidents, swift response times can be the difference between life and tragedy. It is deeply concerning that the current plan falls short in prioritizing unimpeded access for emergency services, a matter of utmost importance that should take precedence in any revitalization endeavor.

Related to Athletics: I have substantial reservations regarding the proposed athletic fields and their proximity to the marina. The proximity of the athletic fields threatens to disrupt marina access, increase traffic and noise levels, contribute to excessive light pollution, and potentially compromise the visual appeal and tranquility of the marina. It seems that the planners may be attempting to fit the athletic fields into a space that is too small to accommodate them adequately, raising several significant concerns that should be carefully addressed.

I’m concerned that the current plans divert from the Liberty State Park's core essence captured in the 1978 planning document, which emphasized its identity as a place of natural beauty and serenity. Given its status as a state park with national significance, I firmly believe that the park should remain committed to preserving its natural landscape, offering scenic views, and fostering an environment that celebrates nature. Introducing athletic fields may compromise the park's natural integrity, and I urge that careful consideration be given to the original vision for Liberty State Park.

Liberty State Park's unique beauty and historical significance deserve to be upheld for future generations to cherish. I appeal to all stakeholders involved in the revitalization plan to consider these concerns seriously and work collaboratively towards a solution that honors the legacy and future of Liberty State Park.

I'd be happy to meet with the task force to discuss these ideas and to help in any way that I can.",briandgoldin@gmail.com

A few things I hope will make it into the design , are  more  affordable options for a family visiting the park to enjoy something to eat . The current restaurants are beautiful , but for a family of four looking to enjoy a small bite to eat or drink , those restaurants are really not an option, some kind of concession stand like what was here in the past would be nice .  Another addition I think would benefit the park , is a covered stage with electricity for concerts and possibly theatrical   plays in the park . A covered stage would benefit the musicians and there equipment in the heat of summer , also ,with already having permanent electricity  it would eliminate the need for gas powered generators which are currently used .  This past years Tuesdays summer  concert series , had a mobile stage from Jersey City , it was the smaller stage that the musicians were sitting on top of each other .

Joseph Seaman,,"I am a long-time resident of Jersey City.

Liberty State Park is just that a ""State"" ""Park"" belonging to the people of ""New Jersey"" and not the special interests of a billionaire real estate developer. It holds an important place in not only the history of New Jersey but also the country. It remains one of the last substantial open space in Norther New Jersey and as such should remain so. The land does not belong solely to the residents of Jersey City and the greater New Jersey community should be considered. The Park is situated adjacent to the State of Liberty and Ellis island National Parks, and does not and should be developed as Recreation Facility serving Jersey City that the city does not need, despite the self serving arguments in opposition to the DEP's plan. The group back by Fireman, has preyed and continues upon the people of Jersey City, using them as pawns in his efforts to execute a major land grab that can not and should not be permitted. The DEP's plan takes a farm more holistic approach to this historic site, providing for some of those recreational needs of the local residents, while maintaining open space and restoring and repurposing some of the historical structures in the park. The alternative plan proposed by Fireman proposes to develop far too much of the existing open space, proposing facilities far in excess of the needs of the community and the state, while paving over much needed open space. The oppositions arguments that their paln will provide facilities to urban residents that exist in the suburbs is fiction, as there are no such facilities the size and scope proposed anywhere in the state. Rather the development should be viewed through the lens of protecting and providing the green space to the urban communities that suburban New Jersey residents enjoy and should be protected and maintained and celebrated at whatever cost.",josephpseaman@gmail.com
Lisa Simms,,"Phase 1B – Audrey Zapp Corridor
There is way, way too much crammed into a very small area of the park. It is excessive. Football, soccer, little league, tennis, basketball and an event lawn. Where will all these folks park? The lights and noise will be horrific. How does this have anything to do with enjoyment of a state park? A lot of editing should be done. One multi-purpose field is sufficient. No skate park in or near the Grove of Remembrance. There is a skate park right up the street from LSP in Barry Lane Park. No viewing areas, and no new paths crisscrossing the Grove! There are more access routes going through the 9/11 Grove of Remembrance, Millenium Park and the LSP north side than there are in the entire 151 acres of the interior. It is way, way too much. The 9/11 Grove of Remembrance has two excellent paths - one paved, active path and one meandering, passive walkway. That is more than enough. Neither the Grove nor the park needs a train. What happened to Never Forget? 

A bicycle path could be constructed next to Audrey Zapp Drive as long as the roots of the mature, 20-year-old Grove of Remembrance trees, which are providing huge environmental benefits, are not destroyed. Perhaps a floating bike path? Innovation with a focus on demonstrating environmentally sound park improvements should be the plan here.  Every path and road should be made of porous pavement. The removal of ANY 20-year-old tree defeats the purpose of environmental sustainability and environmental justice for Jersey City folks. Innovative, sustainable ideas, please. 

The task force had some nice ideas for the train shed, but again, editing is needed. Folks spend entire days in Central Park because it has SOME activities, and many passive activities. No one NEEDS 150 activities in a park. Editing, please. Lots of it.

Phase 2A
Southern Athletic hub
It would seem prudent to fast-track the active recreation component of the Phase 2A. This would create the much demanded active recreation while taking pressure off the rest of the park for ballfields, courts, etc. Make the cleanup and design of this area a priority and focus to alleviate most, if not all, of the active recreation demands. The southern side of the park, in those 50-acreas designated for active recreation, should be the hub of recreation. There’s more parking to accommodate this. The task force members who truly care about Jersey City youth, should decide what kind of recreation will be installed in the southern hub. The quieter area of LSP should be the northern side. 

Phase 2B
 The “existing boat launch area” green space along Morris Pesin Drive from Freedom Way to the Burma Road Grove is filled with trees planted by the NJ Tree Foundation & Friends of Liberty State Park. Starting in 2006 and continuing until about 2019, a diversity of trees (both species and age) were planted to create shade for picnicking and relaxing. As such, many of those trees have been in the ground for 15 years and are supplying much needed ecological benefits. No redesign of any kind should happen in this buffer area.

The waterfront area should be left alone. Liberty State Park is not Six Flags. Plant trees. Shade the walkways. End of story. And, at all costs, PROTECT CAVEN POINT! 

The task force should NOT be allowed to meet in privacy. Full stop. Every minute of every conversation should be open to the public and videotaped. No closed ‘executive sessions’. You could tell from some of the task force members comments that they “felt the cameras” – this is a good thing, creating open, honest dialog that is so important to a community-based process. No closed sessions. Also, task force members should be required to stay until the last community member has spoken. No exceptions. If they cannot remain to hear what the community wants, then they should not be on the task force. Additionally, task force members should come to the meetings prepared – not reading the 174 pages of public input is unacceptable. This is an important commitment and should be taken seriously.",LSimms@njtreefoundation.org
Gary Murphy,,"I strongly support the DEP’s plan for Liberty State Park.  The plan strikes a balance between the needs for both active and passive recreational opportunities.

Mark Trainer,,One more comment from a recently submitted comment. I believe a large dog park perhaps in the interior Millennium Park area would be a great amenity for the community. There are not any other very large dog parks in Jersey City that I'm aware of which allow dogs to really roam and this would be a perfect location to complement the other proposed uses.,mark.trainer1@gmail.com
Mark Trainer,,"Hello,

Overall, I'm very excited about the plans for Liberty State Park and think it is heading in the right direction by balancing passive nature with active recreation and community-orientation at the north end. My specific comments are below.
- I prefer the original concept for the North Athletics Club over the proposal alternatives. There is a dearth of large spaces for healthy active recreation in Central Jersey City and this is an ideal location in a beautiful setting. I'm especially supportive of the running track and soccer field in this location to appeal to the broadest potential user base. I think it makes sense to keep this section of the northern park as the sports focused area with more passive areas elsewhere. I also believe the boat yard should be repurposed to a more community-wide benefitting use if possible.
- I prefer the South of Cove Amphitheater option. This will provide amazing skyline and park views and I think it will feel less congested than including it on the north side next to the beach. I prefer the wood bench on grass terraces seating option as it has a more natural feel than the concrete.
- On transportation, I believe we should encourage non-car modes of travel to the greatest extent possible and repurpose some of the proposed parking spaces toward passive green space. I support a robust shuttle system and think there should be significant investment in making a pleasant transfer experience from both the Liberty State Park light rail station and Grove Street PATH station.
- On Phase 2, I believe the focus should be on supporting more unstructured recreational opportunities and the ability to escape from the City. I think some athletic facilities at the Southern Athletics Hub make sense but that the rest of the area should be more passive in focus.

Max Dickman,,"To whom it may concern,

I am deeply concerned and frankly outraged that any plan to develop the area of Liberty State Park into commercial indoor sports venues for private profiteering off public land is even being considered. LSP is an important public use outdoor space and wildlife refuge, and it's crucial that it remain that way. I'd like to voice my overwhelming support for the DEP plan to create a wildlife refuge and passive recreation, open to the public, for visitors of the park. 

Not only is the park a wildlife refuge, it's also at severe risk for flooding. Developing concrete structures and sidewalks puts the entire downtown Jersey City area at worse risk of flooding by removing a large water drainage area. We cannot allow a billionaire to destroy the ecosystem for wildlife and people by developing on this land. 

All in all, entertaining the outlandish notion of constructing privately held arenas, rinks, and other concrete monstrosities on public green space is absolutely ridiculous. Under no circumstances can the beauty and vibrancy of Liberty State Park be destroyed in favor of paid indoor entertainment.

Friends of Liberty State Park,,"Friends of LSP PHASE 2 statement on Freedom Way Corridor and Pesin Drive Corridor and also Opposing Structured Active Recreation in the Phase 2 “Freedom Way Corridor” of the Waterfront Great Green Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk, and north to south between ferry lot and gravel road just before Nature Center.

This statement doesn't include the already planned Phase 1A  and doesn't address at this point, the 50 acres of free active recreation on south side of the Interior.

“Freedom Way Corridor” recommendations
Maybe there’s space for another sensibly located playground and shaded picnic tables to be near a shuttle bus stop but not interfering with Green Park's 88 acre festivals footprints. Also there needs to be the safest bike paths possible in both directions of Freedom Way (it was suggested to perhaps lessen the space on Freedom Way islands for those bike paths as it'd be hard to do with the ""Belgian blocks"" having been installed on the eastern side of Freedom Way). Also water fountain stations along Freedom Way and if possible next to Liberty Walk.

""Morris Pesin Drive” corridor
 The main entrance to LSP with Lady Liberty 2000 feet away from the Scenic Overlook South Lawn. LSP’s south side is the Non-Commercial Family and Friends Picnicking Side of LSP! It mainly needs creative rehabilitation of the 3 historic jetties for walking, fishing, signage, etc.(easternmost jetty has a tiny beach for kayak launching). The southside picnic tables are new since Sandy; the playground is 5 years old, and what google maps is calling the “Pesin Drive Grove” of about 158 trees the Friends planted between the boat launch lot 2 and lot 3 is getting increasingly more popular for picnics and barbecues- especially with the original picnic table area by the office filled up on nice weekends. Also, the sidewalk along LSP’s southside and by the original picnic table area is overdue for renovation.

On the Great Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk:
LSP’s priceless waterfront 88-acre Great Lawn must be preserved for its essential and irreplaceable purpose of green free urban scarce open space in the ""Freedom Way Corridor"". 

The funded surrogates of billionaire Fireman will likely push sports facilities for the 88-acre Waterfront Great Green Lawn - despite the 50 acres promised in LSP’s interior and some acres along Zapp Dr. and in southside’s lot 1.
It'd be like building sports facilities in Central Park's ""Great Lawn”. NYC residents would not accept that for one second! LSP’s Waterfront Great Green Lawn – the Green Park - is essential for varied urban open space activities and periodic special event festivals.
Structured active recreation sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Green Lawn would cast aside LSP’s primary purpose as a public, green, free, urban scarce, priceless open space for unstructured active recreation, passive recreation and nature enjoyment. It would be an obscene crime to assault the most important urban open space lawn in the USA! 

An editorial once stated that the dramatic, panoramic view from LSP is the ""signature view of our civilization” - American soul-stirring and heart-stirring views from the Great Green Lawn's open space. The waterfront lawn, known as the ""Green Park”, is one of the most important urban open space lawns in the world with the dramatic vistas toward NYC, Lady Liberty, Ellis Island and river/bay - going east to west between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk and including Freedom Way’s playground, and going north to south between the ferry parking lot and cherry tree hill by the Nature Center. 

That waterfront lawn is deserved by future generations of urban people for their quality of life for unstructured active recreation and passive recreation, and is crucial for periodic special events which raise some revenue and bring people to the park to enjoy cultural events such as the past Star-Ledger Jazz Festival, All Points West rock festival, kite festivals, last year's Juneteenth festival, Veuve Clicquot Polo event etc. Sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Lawn would prevent/interfere with a needed footprint for use of the Green Ring and Crescent Lawn areas for large special events which sometimes go northward toward the large playground.

The best plan for structured active recreation is the 50 interior acres, the lawn by the marina (but not taking away boaters’ parking spaces, and the 2 acres in southside’s Lot 1.

All of LSP including the waterfront Great Green Lawn is our urban backyard and America’s Great Lawn and is an essential emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual public health resource -an urban haven, oasis, refuge, sanctuary and escape for people to get away from the crowded, congested, and noisy Jersey City. Overwhelmingly expressed in 47 years of battles is that LSP’s urban green open space is its highest, best, and wisest use for now and future generations- for unstructured active recreation such as, walking, running, biking, pick-up games, playgrounds, kids running free in grass, families and friends kicking or throwing balls, kites, dog-walking, etc., and passive recreation like picnics, BBQs, relaxing on benches and blankets, birding, view-watching and taking scenic photos.

Festivals are awesome LSP cultural uses but only done periodically so LSP doesn’t become the PNC Arts Center with every weekend traffic jams blocking access to regular LSP users on summer weekends -no matter how many shuttles. LSP is already jampacked on all nice weekends and the habitats and trails, active recreation, Terminal re-use is coming.

Many urban residents have no front yard or backyard and may go away for a day or two to the beach in the summer but we don't have summer homes and LSP visits are the highlight of people's lives - to come alone, or with family or friends to chill, bond, play, create memories.

In the ""briefing"" document for this travesty task force (established by the billionaire's LSP law), Commissioner Shawn LaTourette’s first line was that LSP is one of the few remaining contiguous open green spaces along the highly developed northern NJ/NYC waterfront.

I'm sure people anywhere who had a Great Lawn facing NYC’s skyline and the Statue of Liberty, harbor, etc. would want to keep the Great Lawn as it is, with soul-soothing walkways and bikeways, gardens, and trees (but not trees in middle of unstructured active rec open space ).",friendsoflibertystatepark@gmail.com
Peter Madison,,"Liberty State Park is a treasure. Beautiful open spaces, relaxing atmosphere. Comparable to New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Although there are other parks in Jersey City there are none that are nearly as open and beautiful. In addition, it provides habitat to wildlife, which is increasingly under threat from urban and suburban development.
Its large open spaces also provide a buffer against coastal flooding, which is going to get worse as the climate warms.
All of these benefits would be destroyed by the large spectator sports and concert venues which are being proposed.

The proposal for constructing one or even two multi-seat stadiums is an attack on the very nature of the park--a jewel to be polished but at the same time preserved for us and our children and grandchildren. 
My only practical suggestions are 1) to study closely the best means of safe entry and exit for cars, pedestrians and bikers at both ends of the park as well as transit through the park, and 2) to take into account and incorporate into the historical displays in the terminal building the remarks made by the Rutgers Professor from Newark about the early history of the park (the massacre if indigenous people in the 17th century and the labor of slaves in the eighteenth century).",cr_puglisi@yahoo.com

Sam Pesin,,"hi DEP staff,
Balaam on the task force, I registered presume so I can enter a comment. I wasn't allowed to read my statement at the task force meeting to save time but I was told that I could speak during the public comment portion but I decided not to with the meeting going till 4:30. So here's my statement for the public record on behalf of the Friends of Liberty State Park and myself at the task force member:  I'll start by stating that it was sickening that task force members who have gotten Fireman money and at least three of the political patronage appointees left before the public speaking:
                     
The Friends of LSP strongly support the responsible, inclusive, democratic DEP Revitalization” process of professional park-design planning consultants presenting proposals for essential robust public participation input, and also input from this task force. The Friends are serving under protest on this travesty task force.

The task force was set up in the fast-tracked law passed by billionaire Paul Fireman’s lobbyists and the task force includes his two front groups, heads of nonprofits he’s funded, others who support the Sports and Entertainment Complex"" and some misinformed political patronage appointees. As reported in the news, Fireman's front group headed by Hurley has revived their Sports and Entertainment Complex assault on the park with this new version being a 5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue.

His front groups pushed lies and smear attacks to kill the LSP Protection Act and for two years and pushed their exclusionary, traffic-jam causing, admission-fee Sports and Entertainment Complex plan which cast aside decades of the overwhelming broad public consensus, by many 10’s of 1000’s of people wanting a Central Park type Park. The Protection Act which would’ve protected the Caven Point Natural Area which Fireman still wants and would’ve banned the destructive Sports and entertainment Complex.

The Commissioner thankfully and heroically rejected their public land grab last May but with zero respect for the public land behind LSP, they’ve revived it and ignore that the DEP has promised 60 acres for free structured active recreation. This billionaire’s task force is a shameful symbol of our democracy right behind Lady Liberty by his assault on this free public land by Fireman colluding with bought off puppets and politicians.",pesinliberty@earthlink.net
Michael Coiro,,"As a current Jersey City resident, lifelong New Jersey resident, and licensed New York attorney, I am strongly opposed to Paul Fireman’s privatized commercial venue development plan in Liberty State Park. The people of this area are not as foolish as Mr. Fireman thinks they are, nor are they flailing, helpless pawns that exist merely to nod along and “green-light” whatever his well paid lobbyists ask us to approve. This is an obvious attempt to grab profit and influence off of an unnecessary development project that would (1) disrespectfully destroy a pristine, untouched gem of land along the mouth of the Hudson River (with the world’s best view of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan), with no close duplicate or equal on Earth, (2) waste city resources on a highly expensive, completely unnecessary project that would create barriers to access of this precious, public land, and (3) fly in the face of clear public opinion on the issue. We have very little green space in this city, state and region of our country, and public spaces are critically important to the mental health of city residents, both rich and poor. For further clarity, without Liberty State Park’s vast, freely accessible acreage, I would genuinely not want to live in Jersey City anymore - I could afford to do so financially (though others with lesser means would continue to be squeezed out of public enjoyment of their own land, which is despicable), but approval of Mr. Fireman’s plan would clearly demonstrate to me that Jersey City is not serious about protecting its only nature sanctuary; worse yet, it would illustrate that this city would auction off its only meaningful public land to make some extravagantly wealthy developers a few more bucks, seemingly only in exchange for political backing and an excuse to trumpet the city’s “accomplishment” in making the city somehow more “luxurious” and “desirable”. The park is desirable as is and many of my friends of similar age and means have also expressed that they would leave Jersey City if Fireman’s plans are approved. There are plenty of other towns in New Jersey, New York, the US, and the world that prioritize public land, access to nature and the associated mental health aspects therewith (including my hometown of Tewksbury Township, NJ). Your tax base will leave you if you move forward with Paul Fireman’s plan - the ball is now in your court to choose. Thank you for your consideration.",mikecoiro7@gmail.com

Please understand that my family and everyone we know are hugely supportive of the state’s phase 1A, 1B, and 2 plans. Fireman’s plan for a commercial sports and entertainment complex is not what we’re looking for.

Kerry Bass,,"Hello - my name is Kerry Bass and I'm the chair of Sustainable Verona in NJ. I would urge you to google the University of Barcelona study of water samples taken between 2014 and 2021. Artificial turf grass accounted for 15% of larger plastics found in samples within about a half-mile of the shoreline.  As the artificial grass breaks down, small pieces of plastic make their way into soil and waterways, contributing to plastic pollution. Ocean plastics like those near Barcelona threaten animals and ecosystems. For example, birds, fish, and turtles mistake plastic for prey. Their stomachs can become lined with it, causing them to starve. They may also suffer from infections, cuts, internal injuries, and reduced swimming abilities.

And that's only one of the things that our team has discovered wrong with artificial turf.  Artificial turf causes more injury than natural grass. There is a study that looked at 53 articles published between 1972 and 2020. The studies concluded higher rates of injuries on turf. The president of the NFL Player's Union posted a letter stating that artificial turf is harder on the body than natural grass. The studies all point to more injuries with artificial turf.

Most recently, a Philadelphia Inquirer article postulated the risk between artificial turf and cancer. Those risks should cause great concern.

I would urge you to take a look at the studies and literature out there highlighting all the problems with artificial turf. The general public is not aware of these problems, and only sees shiny new fields. As planners and designers, it is your duty to take all of the downsides into consideration. Wouldn't it be great if Jersey City could take the lead in enhancing our environment rather than causing it more harm?",kerrybass@verizon.net
Eric Allen Conner,,"In addition to my oral advocacy today, I wish to say that, in addition to wetland restoration to help mitigate flooding risk, there should be no further permanent expensive structures built in the park as they will necessitate costly repairs in the eventual storm surge of the next hurricane.

I did appreciate the comment that the Phase 2 athletic hub be composed of configurable and modular infrastructure to respond to flexible and ever-changing needs in our diverse state. 

Additionally, on Phase 1B, I think it best to put tennis or racquet courts on that northern cove lot for three reasons: 1) helps shave down but doesn’t eliminate marina parking; 2) once they’re in there, they’re relatively low-cost and resilient infrastructure that is in popular demand; and 3) it will make it harder for a future administration to rip them out in favor of another type of sporting facility due to loss aversion. 

In short, but the least offensive stuff in now, get the community using it, and that will protect the park into the future. Human psychology is the DEP’s friend here.",ericallenconner@gmail.com

While Phase 1A and 1B seem like terrific additions , the private complex almost seems to cancel this benefits out.

James Sanderson,,"I attended the Liberty State Park Design Task Force meeting today, 3/2/24, and would like to, yet again, register my strong opposition to the proposed 7000 seat stadium and the 5000 seat auditorium that would take up the entirety of the undeveloped central section of the park.  While I applaud the provisions for the wide range of various community athletic activities proposed for the northern and southern ends the of the park and the cultural uses for the train shed, devoting such a huge portion of the land to only two enormous venues (namely the stadium and the auditorium) would monopolize entirely too much space that cannot then be used for a lot of other purposes.  Not everyone who uses Liberty State Park is into athletics.  Some people enjoy just taking long walks amidst unobstructed scenery or hanging out while contemplating the beauty of nature.  Another issue is that, if 5000 or 7000 cars try all at once to get onto the two-lane roads servicing the area surrounding Liberty State Park after a big concert or tournament, the congestion would be unimaginable.  Even as it is now, without the stadium or the auditorium, traffic on the back roads can jam up for miles during rush hour.  The stadium and the auditorium would simply worsen the problem.  The stadium and the auditorium would also obstruct the view of the skylines, the bay and the Statue of Liberty.  In a part of the country where there is already a decreasing amount of open space, Liberty State Park offers an oasis for people who need to get away from urban sprawl for a few hours.  I also wish to register my opposition to any plans to turn Caven Point into a golf course.  This wildlife habitat needs to be preserved.  I go to Liberty State Park two or three times each week and consider it a priceless resource to protect and cherish, not just for myself but for the Hudson County community, the nation and for the world travelers that put the park on their must-see lists.  We stand at a critical decision point in the redevelopment of the park, and we have only one chance to get it right.

Scott Moulaison,,"Liberty State Park should remain a treasured public resource, free for all to enjoy.

Regarding today's presentation, I not support the inclusion of athletic fields in Liberty State Park. While I understand the desire to provide opportunities for youth woefully served by Jersey City, I think such an action will only encourage the city to continue to ignore their responsibilities.I also think such facilities will be difficult to manage and maintain. If however, athletic fields must be included, they should be built inland, away from the water, and in places with easy access from outside the park. There should be minimal, if any, cost for youth teams to utilize such fields should they be built. 

Parking and public transportation improvement, as well as traffic impact on surrounding communities should continue to be studied and discussed,

The cannot be any major private concert venues constructed in LSP. Any stages should be constructed to fit into the natural environment, be as unobtrusive as possible, and accessible to all.

Lastly, I believe that all subsequent Design Task Force meetings, and indeed any meetings relevant to the future of LSP,  remain open to the public.

Daniel Letts,,"As a lifelong visitor to LSP who has lived in Jersey City since 2017, I strongly support the DEP plan as is. This park belongs to the entire state, not a billionaire whose ulterior motives are clear as day, nor even to a select group of Jersey City residents who think it belongs solely to them.

The plans put forth by the People’s Park Foundation and their acolytes would irreparably change what is one of the country’s true hidden gems. It seems their only goal is to cram as much concrete and as many fields as humanly possible. If they want to found a northern version of IMG Academy, their billionaire financier is welcome to do so — but not on public land that belongs to the entire state. They could not care less about preserving the natural element of the park - which is precisely what makes it so beautiful and so unique.

The DEP plan, which even the PPF praised until their boss told them otherwise, perfectly balances the need for passive and active recreation. Please keep LSP as is.",daniel.j.letts@gmail.com
Robert Smith,,"1. The NJDEP must ensure the public that the 240 contaminated acres must be properly cleaned and remediated. The money has been available for 12 years. Clean the contamination now. Do it properly so people in jersey city don’t get sick 

2. There has been no official report that has been published that proves bringing water in the park will prevent flooding in surrounding Jersey City. Publish the documents from the Army Corp (they were present at the ribbon cutting) that show Phase 1a will not prevent flooding in the city. Data rules, not words from elected officials. Publish the data from the state engineers. We do not need more flooding in the city. 

3. We need more active recreation. I understand jersey city government is the issue. The city government has forgotten its citizens, but this is an urban park with 300k plus people living around the park. Open it up for active recreation and a community center. We need a community center. The kids need an outlet and there is 600 acres in the park. 

4. The notion of commercialization and making money off the park by Paul Fireman is absurd. Sam Pesin and the friends have receive checks from many events that come in LSP. Polo Classic $50k to FOLSP. Tough Mudder 10k check. Who is profiting off the park. Let’s ask Mr. Pesin. All money that comes to this park should be plowed back in to the park. LSP is running an annual deficit. Money should not line Sam Pesin’s pockets. Make it go back in the park. 

5. We need bathroom and concession stands. We talk about a Central Park like park. Well Central Park has bathrooms, coffee shops, 21 baseball fields, tennis courts, pickle ball, basketball, tennis, handball, a museum and a zoo. People pay money to use the boats on the lake and go to the zoo. Not everything in life is free and money then goes to run and update the facilities. 

Central Park is a gem. LSP is a lump of coal that could be a diamond but will need much attention, care, investment and foresite. LSP is not a preserve it’s a park. A park is for the people. LSP can provide everything. 

Finally, we already are surrounded on water by on three sides. We don’t need more water in the park. Build an internal lake, but don’t bring the Hudson River in LSP. TERRIBLE IDEA.",strains_redox_0d@icloud.com

Clara Richardson,,"I approve the DEP plans you presented today for LSP; thank you for resisting the commercial interests that seek development in the park. Urban humans have a deep and real need for open green space and access to nature. Some active recreation areas for local youth is a good compromise for this location. [Artificial turf needs to be avoided for all the reasons stated. It is essentially poisonous to the land -including the fish that the anglers come to the park for.] I even find myself approving the idea for an amphitheater, as proposed, fitting into the land.

Any confusion (or disinformation) about the wetlands plan demonstrates the lack of understanding of the importance of wetlands in the first place. That makes their inclusion even more important -- along with some good signage!

Over the long term, the 'greatest deficit' of this region will increasingly be open green space and access to nature. Liberty State Park is uniquely positioned to be that asset. As precious and worth fighting for as it is now, just think how much more uniquely valuable it will become as this area becomes even more highly populated.

Cynthia Sanford,,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment.  (I couldn't figure out how to raise my hand online for a phone comment.)  I fully agree with the overwhelming tide of public opinion today that favors open green space--green space that is true to the park's natural state as possible.  People who study education and child development say that exposure to nature is one of the best gifts and learning experiences a child can have.  

Expensive, enlightened private schools know this and many make exposure to nature a core part of their mission. Many local residents cannot afford a private school experience, but If Liberty State Park is preserved as a natural green space, it will be available free to local, regional, and visiting children to have personal, immersive experience with nature.  

For a half century, Camp Liberty has done an outstanding job of giving local children a great experience of recreation in nature.  Tuition is reasonable and there are scholarships for many who need them.  Camp Liberty educators make great use of Liberty State Park's natural environment.   I am sure that many school teachers use the park for educational programs in nature as well.

John Joseph,,"Thank you for the presentation and discussion today (March 2nd) at the Liberty State Park Design Task Force Meeting.  I broadly support the plan as it stands. My comments  :

* I support reducing the space between the sports facilities in the north side next to the Marina. I also like the idea of keeping parking further away and using public transportation / bike shares etc., to bring people to the sites. Any parking lot should emphasize secure bicycle parking and have trees set in a way to shield it from public view. 
* I like the wider natural seating options for the amphitheater. My preference is for the amphitheater to be located on the north side of the cove.  I would prefer not having a clamshell design; rather I would go for something more open and flexible. Also, only free activities should be hosted there.
* I think the amount of space allocated towards active recreational activities in Phase 1B is sufficient. I like that the active facilities are located together instead of scattered across the park. 
* As part of the overall active recreation features, a biking loop should be created along the Audrey Zapp Dr - Freedom Way - Morris Pesin Dr - Philip St for the ""active"" cyclists (think lycra) and to separate them from the other bike paths that would be used for more casual movement.  
* There is very little access to green space in Jersey City and Hudson County. Hence it is important to ensure that green spaces are prioritized in the design of the Park. The high volume of traffic in the park attests to the preference that people have for the current emphasis on passive recreation. 
* Future meetings of the Task Force should be broadcast live online. There is no need of public commentary at these meetings, but there should be transparency regarding its deliberations, especially given the apparent push to make material modifications to the existing plan.",jonvjoe@yahoo.com
Jane Conrad,,"I support the plan to make Liberty State Park a Central Park-style park with FLEXIBLE green spaces.  That is a design that has stood the test of time and served the people well.

Please do NOT use plastic artificial turf in this location.  Artificial turf gets extremely hot, raises flood risk, and contains PFAS and other neurotoxins and endocrine disruptors.  Why should local youth be exposed to these harmful substances?  As well, when this area does flood, all the crumb rubber and loose plastic grass blades are going straight into the estuary.

Instead, please consider setting up a program at Liberty State Park to train local youth in how to manage NATURAL GRASS for lawns and sports fields, how to care for trees, and how to maintain sustainable natural spaces.  Train kids to be stewards of the land, and this can lead to them getting green jobs and protecting ALL of our futures.",jspjnc@aol.com

Eugene Ferrara,,"It is clear that the current plans do not take into consideration the existing and flourishing services of Liberty State Park. Specifically, the marina and the restaurants. it is also very clear that the plan does not have any concept of current or future needs for traffic flow throughout the park and the area of Jersey City that the park borders. The plan should be altered to leave everything alone on the north waterfront area and to enhance the entry roadway by putting in a four-lane roadway where the cobblestones are, and to the south and also enhancing the roadway to the west. By doing so, it will open up the area that is just south of the current cobblestone Audrey's Zapp drive and venues that are being requested such as ball fields, tennis courts etc can be a accommodated in that section. However, again, this is not Jersey City Park. It's Liberty State Park and as such the venue should be for the mass of the state, not for the specific needs of Jersey City. Focus should be on redoing the bulkhead along the north wall of the marina  property.

Zi Lin Liang,,"I am writing in support for the Liberty State Park Revitalization Program introduced by NJDEP.

The Revitalization Program reiterates that Liberty State Park is a public good for all. I strongly oppose any inclusion of privately-owned facilities, specifically those proposed by the People's Park Foundation. Public parks are one of the few third places people can gather and enjoy without any financial expense.

Maureen Crowley,,"The first director of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather, envisioned both national and state parks as a great system containing “the highest potentialities of national pride, national contentment, and national health…A visit inspires love of country; begets contentment; engenders pride of possession; contains the antidote for national restlessness…”  

Liberty State Park speaks to Mather’s vision in many ways.  It’s not just that the site looks out at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, symbolizing core values and immigrant history to all visitors and to our city's diverse population. It’s also that the park to some extent balances the ceaseless building, fueled by the profit-motive, of the city around it, and of the city whose skyline is visible from it. It’s that the park was created and is sustained through grassroots people power. The preservation of Central Railroad terminal is a material reminder that we respect our architecture and our history. 

That history, however, should be recognized not only for its achievements, but for its ills,  starting with the displacement and erasure of indigenous peoples who once used the lands of LSP, and including the environmental degradation left behind by the railroads once their profits declined. The land restoration that has taken place in Liberty State Park gives us hope that we still have a collective ability to address our historical mistakes and injustices and maybe even have a chance to address overwhelming challenges like human-caused climate change.

The DEP has been leading a process to improve the park and balance interests. My own view is “less is more”-- that the park should not be used to satisfy the city’s needs for active recreation. If active recreation to the park, however, is added it should be explicitly acknowledged that it is not a precedent encouraging future incremental increases in active uses and more infrastructure. Instead, the goal for the park should be respect for the open land and water, for habitat and nature education, for providing rare opportunity for our children to be in touch with nature. It should be the primary responsibility of Jersey City and the developers seeking to build in the city to provide for the active recreational needs of our growing population and our children, and to address the needs of communities near LSP whose residents want more recreational opportunities. 
 
The future should not include an exclusionary Sports and Entertainment Complex or any other large-scale commercial uses.   Increased automotive traffic should be discouraged. Any added circulation paths should use permeable surfaces. Park entry should be and remain free. The park should not be viewed as a revenue-producer, but as the People’s Park, open and free to all.

Nicole Greco,,"NJ's DEP, by its own definition, describes itself as an ""unfailing guardian of New Jersey's most precious natural and historic resources.""  

Mr. Fireman wants to turn LSP into the only product he knows how to sell- something for a youth-driven, entertainment-above-all-else, American stereotype. This entire thing reeks of ageism, classism and the outmoded capitalism that drove trees out of places like Jersey City in the first place. 

I ask the DEP to fulfill its duty to protect the state's natural and historic resources at this critical juncture. On the historic side, there's the Morris Canal.  The natural resources are too extensive to list.  Just following the line of thinking that  LSP is one of the most vulnerable salt marshes in the entire Hudson estuary- have environmental groups on the other side of the Hudson (and upriver) been invited to attend/comment/weigh in?  The boundaries of the estuary region include both NJ and NY. If Fireman's vision comes true, and he gets to replace entire swaths of greenspace with impervious surface, how would that not play into regional floodin

LSP was a gift to present and future generations by planners and taxpayers. The park, and subsequent remediations have been bought and paid for by taxpayers with the intent of creating greenspace access for all. It took decades to get the land to reach its environmental potential. Replacing it with concrete and other impervious surface is an enormous step  backward and will only benefit some for a finite period of time. The region is not short on recreational space- with two major arenas within 10 miles and world-class sports facilities available for contract and use at public institutions nearby.

Where is the proof? The need for preserving this space is well documented by not only the NJ DEP, the EPA but even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gets it: their analysis of the Hudson River estuary concludes the following: ""The vulnerability of the entire area continues because of its desirability for development opportunity. Only comprehensive planning that recognizes the habitat values of this area, coupled with analyses of the impact to the habitat of individual proposals taken in the context of cumulative impacts, will result in balanced and effective protection of the estuary.

Where, then, is the scientifically proven, measured, monitored and cross-referenced demand for more recreation in Northeastern New Jersey? Access to all the proposed activities in Fireman's plan already exist, nearby, and are reachable via mass transit. Trading environmental resources for additional entertainment is a poor investment with decreased ROI in the face of climate change. It's bad economics, short-sighted planning and a disturbing example for younger generations. 

Although the plan is presented as a way to benefit today's youth, let's remember this, today's youth are in a mental health crisis. They worry about their future, their world. Pour concrete today, and it will take decades for them to restore LSP to its current glory.

LSP is for the people. This plan is for the age demographic with the most disposable income. One example: amphitheaters and arenas are not welcoming places for elderly or disabled people but the park is. There's no democratization when you replace flat, soft ground with multi-level concrete staircases.

The head of DEP, Shawn LaTourette, pushed back against concerns that the park would be commercialized, as many conservationists have long feared. In a call with reporters on Thursday morning, he said the plans don’t include any large-scale developments, like a large community center, entertainment venue or track and field stadium.

“Liberty State Park will never be a youth sports complex, Liberty State Park will be a park for the people that we will ensure is capable of meeting multiple ends,” LaTourette said.",nicolegreco.sml@gmail.com
Samuel Pott,,"moved to Jersey City in 2004. Raised my family here. Homeowner. Over 19 years I’ve built Nimbus Dance and Nimbus Arts Center - the largest arts non-profit in Jersey City which serves over 16000 annually including 6 youth each year with ongoing arts.

Investment in and preservation of open green space is one of the single best ways to ensure the long-term health of our community.

There is nothing like parks and open green space to preserve long term value to property, to retain residents, and to maintain the sense of identity and character that we all love about Jersey City. 

What would New York City be without Central Park, Riverside Park? What would Brooklyn be without Prospect Park? If instead of preserving parkland we had built stadiums where our National Parks now stand - Yellowstone, Yosemite, Acadia - in those days the profiteers wanted dams, oil wells, and mines. Gratefully open space was preserved and our nations greatest natural sites will be available for future generations. 

Liberty State Park is no different. This is one of our nation’s most important public spaces. We can’t get this wrong.

Jersey City has experienced rampant development that has not included important investments in green space. 

Should we build opportunities for youth activities? absolutely yes. But more out-of-control, for-profit development of one of Jersey City’s precious few open green spaces?  Definitely not.

I have trained for multiple marathons here, and I absolutely love the park as it is now - a free, public space where I can connect with nature in our city.

Reni Stoll,,"LSP is our only natural sanctuary offering refuge and a much needed respite from the busy city life, we use it when we need a break from the noise, construction and litter pollution we face daily. We need to keep it as natural as possible with native vegetation, organic paths, unobstructed vistas. We want Central Park of Jersey City. We want to see the sky, the water, birds, trees. We want to connect with nature.  We don't want to see buildings, stadiums and venues. There are plenty of opportunities in other areas of Jersey City. Fix what we have. Keep the fields in LSP open, green and free. Let's not fall prey to greed, monetization and commercialization. Thank you. Reni",renistoll12@gmail.com
Judith Green,,"I am following the deliberations on LSP for the North Jersey Sierra Group. Our point of view was well expressed by Adam Nolan of the NJ League of Conservation Voters. We strongly endorse the revitalization, clean-up, restoration (e.g., of wetlands), preservation and enhancement of the land, public land, for the use of all. We are opposed to any commercial development of the Park. As we have commented in the past to the DEP, the remaining natural jewel in the region called Cavens Point must be protected from development. We stand with Sam Pessin and the Friends of Liberty State Park.",jugreen547@gmail.com
Joann Brennan McKee,,"A park is a place of refuge, where people can go to experience nature and escape the pressures of daily life. It is not a football stadium, or a major concert venue, or a casino development, or a golf course. It cannot be used to fill the recreational void that is rightly the responsibility of Jersey City. Liberty State Park should be treated, as are other state parks, as primarily a place of respite.

A slowly growing trend in the U.S. is the acquisition and return to nature of golf courses, eliminating their environmental pollution and overuse of water. See the New York Times article of 2/15/24, entitled “After Shutting Down, These Golf Courses Went Wild.” This is an option that NJDEP should consider. Adding the current golf course space to the park would eliminate the pollution generated by the golf course and would provide additional space for active recreation without compromising the intrinsic nature of a state park. It would also eliminate the constant pressure from the golf course owner and his agents to privatize the park.

The NJDEP must not lose sight of its core mission by turning Liberty State Park into a commercial venture. The park is a precious resource and needs to be protected in perpetuity, because once it’s gone, it’s gone.",jmcbmck@aol.com
Becky Hoffman,,"Thank you for  hosting this meeting on 3/2 in person at Liberty State Park and with the opportunity to participate via zoom and this comment box.  Please make sure the process continues to be OPEN and transparent.  Too much has been done behind closed doors that has increased misinformation and animosity when there is more in common than not.  However, the one area where there is extreme disagreement is on any efforts to privatize any part of the park - that cannot happen.  Liberty State Park needs to remain free and open to all.

I am a resident of Jersey City AND the State of New Jersey.  The City of Jersey City is primarily responsible for recreation spaces  and has failed the community in that respect.  That said, there is room for both recreation and open space in LSP. What is Not negotiable is turning over the park to private interests or creating a sports and entertainment complex as endorsed by those supported by Paul Fireman.  

The  vision of this  park as an oasis for our community and those in the state of NJ and that includes the proposed 60 acres of recreational space while protecting and restoring the wetlands is important. Finding the proper balance should be the role of this task force.

The commissioner mentioned hosting large events like fan events for the World Cup. While exceptions for unusual events like this should be allowed with proper permitting - this is NOT the general use of the park for the public on a daily basis.  It should be primarily for the residents of JC and New Jersey who need a respite from the challenges of urban life.

Last, I liked to say that the Task Force should listen to Sam Pesin and Friends of Liberty State Park.  They have been stewards for the park since its inception and have guided it  with vision and passion and making it sure it remains free and open for all.",bhoffman45@comcast.net
Shayna Marchese,,"I support Liberty State Park remaining a free, open green space for the people of New Jersey, and support the current revitalization plan. I do not support any attempts to privatize or commercialize the park.

There's been a lot of discussion about active recreation in the park, specifically referring to adding more active recreation for residents of Bergen-Lafayette. Historically, diverse communities like Bergen-Lafayette have been excluded from nature activities (called the ""Nature Gap""). Pushing the rhetoric that active recreation is more important than passive enjoyment of nature is enforcing the Nature Gap, not working to end it. We should be focusing on making outdoor spaces welcoming to all, and a key part of that is ensuring that we have natural spaces at all that are close enough for people to visit regularly. Some active recreation at LSP is fine but no matter how much is added to the plans, more is pushed for. Passive recreation is also more inclusive to more people, as not everyone can participate in active recreation.",shayna.marchese@gmail.com
David Spence,,"Of the 4 options proposed for the phase 1B athletic hub at the north section, the one with tennis and basketball courts may work best for that area for several reasons:

1. This option does not create high amounts of traffic since their uses have a smaller amount of players and less potential for high amounts of spectators. Traffic at the Audrey Zapp entry point is already very congested.
2. Parking needs for these uses is much simpler to plan, and a better scale  
3. Existing Marina access and parking areas are maintained 
4. This option provides smaller areas of storm water runoff when compared to Astro turf fields 
5. They provide active recreational space for local residents.

Due to the size and width of regulation football/soccer fields/running track, the other options eliminate the marina parking and access to the docks which is not practical or a workable solution. These proposed uses also create high amounts of traffic and congestion for organized games and tournaments, and require a much higher degree of management and maintenance. 

Having said this, eliminating 2-3 BB courts would be a more appropriate ratio of developed vs natural space for this part of the park.

I look forward to seeing the direction of the design.

Thank you",david@windigodesign.com
Julie Daugherty,,I completely support the DEP process for planning the park through community input. I believe the park can be improved and can provide active recreation as well as natural areas but making the park a sports and entertainment center is not what the natural park should be changed to - we have to protect the natural parts of the park. It is hard for me to trust the task force because it was appointed- so I don’t know who they are representing. I would ask that all meetings to be opened to the public- if the public is not there we should have access to the transcript or recordings of the meetings so we all know what is being discussed .,juliedaug@gmail.com

The traffic signals are inadequate. This would be a massive, timely, and costly expenditure of public funds, and I don't believe it would generate revenue long term. Furthermore, where would the attendees park? All of the green space within LSP would be gone before we know it.
Soon enough, it wouldn't be a park at all - ""Liberty State Concrete Lot and Pavilion"" they would name it. Just think of the heat radiating off of it in the sweltering summer months. Wouldn't that be breathtaking!",adam.smieszny+depnj@gmail.com
Robb Kushner,,"My name is Robb Kushner, and my wife and I live at 9 Regent Street in Jersey City. We have been residents for 14 years - and we love it here. In addition, our adult children and their two families, including three young grandkids, also live in Downtown JC. 

Liberty State Park is unparalleled as a masterpiece of our parks and natural areas. Whenever I go to Liberty State Park, I feel a deep sense of freedom, peace, and connection to nature. This is a feeling that never gets old - and never goes away. Exploring the different green spaces, observing the wildlife, relaxing on a bench or in the picnic areas, and walking along the waterfront, away from the noise and bustle of the city - these are treasured experiences that refresh and restore me.

Along with all of the individual activities - being in nature, running, and bicycling - available at Liberty State Park, families and groups can take advantage of the rich offerings of Liberty State Park’s playgrounds and picnic areas. Our grandkids, along with so many others, have celebrated wonderful birthday parties there.

I am encouraged by the development of a multi-stage plan for thoughtful development and enhancement of Liberty State Park. This plan shows that we can include active recreation in the park while keeping it as a wonderful public space.

In place of detailed comments related to the proposed design plans for the park, I want to underscore that I, along with many other local area residents, stand very much AGAINST large-scale commercialization and privatization in Liberty State Park, including stadiums and/or concert venues. 

Projects and facilities of this type have no logical place in the peaceful, natural environment of LSP. If these facilities were proposed for Central Park in Manhattan, there’s no question that these ideas would be summarily rejected. The same should be true for our precious local park. 

In addition, we need to fully protect the Caven Point Natural Area Migratory Bird Habitat and Nesting Area from demolition by Liberty National Golf Club.

Finally, moving forward, any future committees and/or task forces focused on LSP should include long-time community stakeholders currently excluded from its decision making committee, such as the Jersey City Parks Coalition, the Urban League of Hudson County, and statewide conservation organizations.

Thank you for helping to keep Liberty State Park a precious green resource for all citizens - not just for those of us who live in Jersey City, but for people who live throughout the state, as well as visitors who travel from far and wide to enjoy this wonderful park.",robbkushner@gmail.com
Beatriz Bofill,,"Liberty State Park is the jewel of New Jersey and this needs to be kept in mind - no large scale commercialization. Phase 1A, Phase 1B, appear to be designed in the spirit of the kind of plan the People want, not so clear in Phase 2.  All phases must insure the design stays a public park for the People.  All parks are democratic spaces where all can come for some peace and tranquility. Liberty State Park should be maintained as a sanctuary where you can relax and decompress, it must stay resoundingly a natural environment in the dense urban area in which it is found.

Please do not sell out to powerful interest who use their financial wealth to buy what is not theirs.  No Commercialization in Liberty State Park, no large Stadiums or Theaters.  It is important to reduce automobile travel to the park.  Encourage and improve public transportation to the park and biking to the park with ample protected bike lanes and bike parking - other micro-mobility devices should also be included in bike planning.",bbofill@yahoo.com
Henry Pullin,,"For decades Liberty State Park has provided people from Jersey City, from New Jersey, and from around the world with the opportunity to connect with nature, connect with the history of our region, and enjoy access to free open space in the middle of one of the most densely populated areas of the world. I believe that it is incredibly important to expand upon and enhance the resources that Liberty State Park currently provides and that the privatization and commercialization of areas of the park, such as the construction of a stadium and other private venues, should NOT occur. Access to free open space and natural areas is very limited in this area. The natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced allowing for more passive and free recreation. The proposed salt water marsh is an excellent example of expanding on and enhancing the open space in the park. Not only will areas like this enable people to connect with and learn about the natural world, they will provide for storm residency and create wildlife habitat. Natural areas should be enhanced and created and existing natural areas should be protected. This includes the Caven Point area, this is a vital natural area that provides habitat and the opportunity for education and passive recreation, it needs to be protected. 

This is not to say that opportunities for public active recreation should not be created. Fields and courts can be created in a concentrated manner in different parts of the park. A great example of a well designed active recreation facilities can be found at the Brooklyn Bridge Park in NYC. Larger fields can possibly be created but should be kept to a minimum. Limiting the uses of areas the park by building large active recreation fields is not fair to people who are looking use the park in a wider variety of ways. 

In summary, the park should be modeled after a Central Park style park, natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced and used as storm water infrastructure, and active recreation should be built but in concentrated areas and not at the expense of natural areas. Additionally, private venues and stadiums should absolutely not be built.

David Burdzy,,"I appreciate the idea of revitalizing Liberty State Park and bringing more opportunities to the community in enjoying their experience. As a born and raised member of Jersey City, I have seen many changes to the city in the past 20 years, which had both positive and negative effects on the community. Seeing these plans, I will say that I do not think adding athletic fields will benefit the park or the community. There are already a handful of city parks full of different sports courts and skateparks surrounding Liberty State Park where kids and teens may play and be active. The purpose of the STATE park is for it to be a conservation of the environment, allowing migratory birds to nest and have their own space. For people to get away from the bustle of the city and to be enveloped in nature. The inclusion of these sports facilities will take that experience away and increase noise pollution that might scare away the birds and other wildlife. It is said that the inclusion of these facilities will bring more people to the park but the park already has many families, runners, and birdwatchers that come causing the parking on the weekends to be full. If facilities are added, more parking space would be needed to be constructed. Remember, this park isn't large enough to include everything this plan wants and to still feel like a state park. Liberty State Park is 1/3rd of Central Park which is why it can include the facilities it has. Jersey City has enough city parks that include facilities which should have revitalizing as well. Add more green space to the city in general. 

I do happen to agree with the inclusion of a community center as long as it's not in any natural wetlands occupied by nature. The facility plans including a community garden and a classroom is important, it helps reach out to the community and our youth to teach about environmentalism and ecology which has a massive influence on our future and the planet's future. I also approve of the Train Shed at the Central Jersey Transit Station to be utilized into a walking space that mixes history and environment, with the inclusion of train cars, more community gardening and even the possibilities of composting or bee gardening. This applies to the amphitheatre space which has a natural design to it. As well as love the idea of art space throughout the park such as the rememberance grove. It would enhance the beauty of the park and allow local artists to reach the community and add a unique personality as well. 

As for the beach, I don't know how I feel about that as a piece of the state park. It doesn't feel right or natural. It clashes with the rest of the design. 

Finally my thoughts on the clean up of the part of the park that is considered the Habitat conservation is important as long as it is an environmental cleanup that is to remove any chemicals and hazards to the wildlife. But I'm not sure if the landscape should be changed physically to include trails if it impedes upon the bird sanctuary and disrupts their habitat. This includes the freshwater wetlands and tidal wetlands if it means bulldozing and creating those spaces, but if they already exist there naturally and left untouched, then it is fine. In the end, the bird sanctuary should be left untouched and far away from human interaction unless it's to the birds benefits, Caven Point included.

Angus Vail,,"I'm very concerned about the Task Force saying they want to meet in private to discuss the park. This smacks of the usual Jersey style politics of deals being done in closed back rooms. 

Also the fact that some of the task force members come from dubious so-called community groups such as people's park foundation who are new groups funded by Paul Fireman and have their own agenda to move Paul Fireman's agenda forward. 

That these representatives have the opportunity to make their false claims about flooding the park, or that there's nothing to do in the park, in a closed door session is very concerning.

Jyoti Shankar,,"Jersey City urgently needs to prioritize expanding its green spaces and tree cover. With one of the lowest green covers in the nation and losing substantially more trees than we plant each year to concrete development, we're setting ourselves up for increased heat absorption in the summers, making the city less resilient to future warming. Instead of further covering areas with concrete, let's maximize the space for trees, especially in Liberty State Park (LSP). A 2015 study by the Jersey City Environmental Commission found the city loses at least 126 trees annually despite planting efforts. This trend has only worsened, with recent reports indicating a decline in the tree canopy to less than 11%. Please see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI8Fu0VSo_C5puB6UHe5XX9VzhfX8xid/view and https://www.tapinto.net/towns/jersey-city/sections/green/articles/making-sure-trees-count-jersey-city-tree-census-shows-a-decline-in-canopy-cover

Building a stadium would only contribute to more concrete and take away valuable free access to the park, favoring private profits over public benefit. This move doesn't align with the needs of the millions of residents who rely on LSP as one of the few free nature spaces available. It's not a wise use of our natural resources and would harm the already fragile biodiversity of these areas. Let's prioritize long-term sustainability and community well-being over short-term gains.

I would like to emphasize. Jersey City residents would like Liberty State Park with more trees and free access to nature. Please don't shrink our access to nature by building concrete stadiums on land that could be used for trees - increasing the health of the community.",jyoti.shankar@gmail.com

Jessica Zimmer,,"Northern Athletics Hub:
- consider that boating (motor, sail, kayak, jet ski, fishing, etc) is active recreation that already exists, please don’t remove / impinge on facilities that make our current, existing recreation less accessible or feasible

- There’s a reason “soccer moms” have minivans or SUVs.  When I take my family to a park or facility for something as short as a 2 hour soccer game, we bring snacks or meals, coolers of ice and water, shade umbrellas or canopy, folding seating or a ground cover, and a way to toilet my little ones.  Remote parking with a bus system makes my trip that much longer and more difficult to lug all that stuff from the car to the sidelines, and would reduce the number of trips we would make each year.

- necessary facilities for sports participants and spectators include fresh drinking water sources and bathrooms at the very least.  I don’t see these sideline facilities on the NAH plans.  If I’m not lugging outside food on the remote parking transfer bus, then I need to be able to buy these things at the field.  I don’t see snack stands or meal options, in fact you’ve even proposed taking away our favorite hotdog stand by liberty house restaurant. I don’t see bathrooms or water fountains.  Cramming the most fields you can fit into the space doesn’t make those fields usable.

Connections to local transportation are inadequate: 
I’m sorry, but JC just isn’t NYC yet.  Central Park has a huge and well established multimodal network of transportation options with connections at every park entrance.  Our HBLR doesn’t even connect to our PATH at more than two points, and neither of those seamlessly.   Our NJTransit buses are not nearly ubiquitous enough to support everyone who wants to access our parks, and inconvenient for families with young children and the supplies to keep them safe and happy for a day out.  Again, having to change from local buses to the park bus system would add a leg to the trip to bring my family to the park will reduce the number of times I’m able to make that trip each year.

A fitness trail already exists along freedom way with exercise stations, shade, and passes by existing water fountains and restrooms.

Tracy Puza,,"I agree with most of Phase 1B, as long as the development does not block the view east to the Hudson River.
My favorite thing to do in the park is walk or bike along the boardwalk. The best thing about Liberty State Park is that it is wide open and honors passive activities and wildlife. Please don't overdevelop. Also, have adequate parking for the sports recreation areas.

RE Phase 2 Holistic long term master plan:
1. It does not seem Holistic.
2. LSP is a STATE park. It should not have to solve all of Jersey City's poor city planning. It should be enjoyed by people from Jersey City and the surrounding area as well as the whole of NJ.
3. The 50 acre sports hub seems excessive, especially considering there will be sports fields in the Northern end (Phase 1B). Also, what about the fields at Caven point, which is owned by Jersey City. Also, ask yourselves who will be playing on those fields? Everyone will be fighting over playing rights.
4. I agree with Ms. Patel's comment about the bird friendly lighting and following dark skies protocols.
5. We need to see statistics about the ""deficiencies"" discussed in the meeting. Why should a state park have to solve all those JC deficiences?",tracypuzapa@gmail.com
carrow thibault,,"The task force does not appear to have a coherent understanding of what the community needs or how to provide it. The plan is being driven by the desire of private individuals to build sports and concert venues for profit, from which revenues might be distributed to as yet unidentified future public facilities in the park. I am skeptical about how much money would be left for playing fields, tennis courts, skate parks or whatever, after operating costs and return on investment are covered. I agree with the point made that the DEP and task force need to come up with real data on needs of the community. It is important to determine how to pay for them- through grants, bonding, etc.- not through disruptive commercial facilities like a sports or concert arena which will generate too much traffic and the requirement for acres of parking (which will be empty most of the time) that would diminish the park's environment by creating more run-off and pollution.
Separate the two issues: 1. public amenities such as playing fields, areas for passive activities, education; and: 2. ticketed sports and concert venues with their huge negative impact on the park . I am certain the City can find ways to pay for public community recreational facilities through local, state and federal funding sources. The venues will open to only those who can pay and overwhelm the area with cars. Locate the venues near mass transit, Not in a park!!",carrow@cthibaultarchitect.com
Jaime Conheeney,,"I keep hearing ""let's get this done ASAP"" by some task force members as an excuse not to be exhaustive in planning and consulting the public and responding to their needs/concerns. However, I would like to point out that if the DEP valued efficiency, then why go with the ""lowest bidder"" for jobs? LSP's nature center took 9 years to reopen because of the lack of support, and also because the contractors were not skilled and did not care and were not being paid that much. The nature center was supposed to open in 2019 then 2020 and each time they were close, something would break and the team would have to fly out from Minnesota to fix it...It finally opened in 2021. Getting the right people to do the work and paying a better company is worth the investment.",amortalidea@gmail.com
Beth Daugherty,,"Commissioner LaTourette just stressed that State Policy has been changed to allow for an athletic hub to be developed and funded within a state park.  This is unprecedented and should be done correctly, even if it takes multiple years.  It is clear that the athletic fields in phase 1B are a stop gap measure to provide playing fields for JC residents until the more comprehensive Athletic Hub in the southern portion of LSP is complete. 

Please do not destroy the marina, an existing asset used by many NJ and Jersey City residents, in order to provide a short term solution for athletics that is riddled with problems.  Placing athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will make an already congested road unbearable and create an untenable shortage of parking for both current marina tenants and all those who hope to use the new fields.  

The intersection of Audrey Zapp and Philips/Jersey Ave has become very congested since the opening of the Jersey Ave bridge, and is already fairly dangerous for the volume of pedestrian and bike traffic that crosses this intersection to access LSP. Additional traffic volume due to those using the proposed athletic fields, combined with those trying to access the renovated Ferry building and Train Shed, will cause this intersection and Audrey Zapp Drive to come to a standstill.  

With over 500 boats in the marina, emergency vehicles, both fire and medical, need immediate and direct access to all of the docks in the marine.  This requires a wide paved area adjacent to the marina. The current tenant parking lot provides this access. 

Another safety aspect that is not reflected in the design is safety netting to prevent balls from going into the dock areas.  These nets would be a terrible eyesore and a danger to the numerous birds around the marina.

When considering alternative parking options for marina tenants, it is important to understand that marina tenants are typically bringing substantial gear and provisions to their boat which requires a car, not mass transit or shuttles.  Once delivering these items to their boat, they then need a guaranteed place to park - for the day, overnight, or for many nights, depending on how long they will be out on their boat.  

A thorough traffic and parking study should be completed during the summer before athletic fields are considered along Audrey Zapp Drive.  Parking needs to be designed and available before facilities are built which bring more traffic. While there are numerous parking lots throughout LSP and in JC just outside the park - they are often full. 

Another unintended consequence of placing the athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will be undermining the success of the Jersey City New City Kids - summer City Sail program.  Over the years Liberty Yacht Club members, who are primarily tenants of the marina, have funded the City Sail paid intern positions for Jersey City high schoolers, funded new sails for the City Sail sailboat, volunteered to help teach the participants how to sail, and LYC members have taken the City Sail participants out on their own boats to increase the number of youth who can experience boating.  If marina tenant parking is greatly reduced, this will cause LYC to lose members who have been instrumental in supporting the City Sail program, potentially ending the sailing aspect of this unique summer program for Jersey City youth. 

If an Athletic Hub is a priority, please design and build it in a responsible way without decimating existing assets and causing a traffic nightmare for all.  Please do not build formal athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive.",btdaugh@gmail.com
Jason Renker,,"Having listened to the entire public meeting, I was distressed by the feeling that Liberty State Park is seen as vacant land by many people who want to bite pieces off it in order to solve all the problems of Jersey City. What makes Liberty State Park special is the fact that much of it is NOT developed for high-traffic, high-density use. Furthermore, I was disturbed by the idea that sections of the park need to be developed to somehow act as a destination for people attending the 2026 World Cup, a one-time event that does NOT serve the needs of local residents.

Having said that, I am not against the development intended for Phase 1B—that area is a patchwork of development already. As long as the amphitheater is very low profile, low impact, and does not make the space useless for other activities, even that feature would be okay.

As for Phase 2, I oppose Phase 2A in its current incarnation. The Southern Athletics Hub is a massively overbuilt idea that, as I mention above, seems to simply give away park land to solve the problems with Jersey City. It would take a huge bite out of Liberty State Park's undeveloped area and make it a destination for concerts and sporting events.

Diani Jones,,"Liberty State Park is one of the largest green spaces in Jersey City.  Privatizing the land for the construction of sports stadiums who increase crowds and noise pollution, distract from the Statue of Liberty and destroy Jersey City’s coastline.  NJ Transit doesn’t have the infrastructure to handle such large groups of people and this would congest the LSP light rail stop which is an essential point of transfer for many commuters.  Without Liberty State Park this reduces the public parks in Jersey City suitable for large gatherings to just Lincoln Park which is less accessible to those in Downtown Jersey City and what will remain of Liberty State Park is a stadium that is empty the majority of the year.",dkjones100@gmail.com
Michele Gillies,,"TRASH!  One of my biggest concerns is that all of this development to bring more people, and concessions, into the park will also bring more trash into the park.  The trash is not really being dealt with now.  I participate in cleanups whenever I can at the park, and my friends and I usually do several cleanups a year at Caven Point…including tires.  So you may build beautiful new spaces, but you need a plan to clean/maintain these spaces going forward.",canucksintrees@yahoo.com
Dylan Elias,,"Very concerned for the parking situation for the marina. Seeing the plans for athletics to take over the parking lot, this is going to inconvenience many people
who regularly use the marina for fishing purposes and for living. Also, putting the athletic fields close to the marina is going to generate a large amount of traffic if not done correctly. Fishing and going out of the marina is very important to the fishing community. Taking away the parking will give a bad experience for people wanting to use the marina, ultimately forcing people to go somewhere else. I want to use this marina in the future and for my children. However, if the parking situation is done incorrectly, it is going to inconvenience many people and ultimately drive them out of using this marina. Which is beautiful and an amazing place for the sport of fishing.",Dylanelias94@yahoo.com
Alexis O'Callahan,,"I am an early-career ecologist born and raised in Hudson County. I also worked at Liberty State Park for a year as a naturalist. I understand that public participation is being solicited, but I am shocked by the calls for ""closed door sessions,"" the plans not being reviewed thoroughly before this meeting, there not being time for task force members to review the public feedback, and the ambiguity of the ""LSP Task Force"". I have a number of comments, all calling for more science and transparency in the design process.

1) Who assembled the task force, and how are you ensuring that this task force is representative of Jersey City and Hudson County stakeholders? Giving the public one comment per session while we listen to task force members sucking the air out of the room is amplifying-- not balancing--power imbalances.

2) I appreciate the commissioner's persistence in trying to consult the public/task force for driving the Revitalization Plan in terms of assessing needs. I think there needs to be a more strategic, systematic approach for assessing community needs, though. Just because someone on the task force or of the public has an interest in Jersey City, does not mean they represent the community's interests (who wouldn't have an interest in one of the greatest parks in one of the greatest cities?). I think conducting social science and geographic research would help minimize biases and those taking advantage of their positions of power/influence to make this Plan into something profitable for themselves. Such studies are done by NYC Parks, e.g. their Social Assessment Surveys, where parks staff interview park users, record where they are in the park, some demographic info (residence etc), and inquire about green space meaning and their needs. This allows the natural resource scientists to track park density and use based on features (e.g. how dense ballfields are vs. bike paths). By analyzing existing use and collecting real data from those who USE the park, you are broadening your stakeholder population and getting a more accurate picture (though this needs to be done across the year).

3) I also think there needs to be a greater geographic scope of assessing needs to identify the uses of existing neighborhood parks & ballfields to track where exactly in the city there is the greatest need. Turning LSP into the ""one size fits all"" for active recreation ignores the fact that this is an unlimited resource. Certain teams/orgs/folks will use the active spaces more than others. There needs to be a more concerted collaboration between the youth sports organizations to ensure this space meets the needs of those who need it, rather than one spokesperson claiming that building more ballfields will solve inequities across the city....

4) There needs to be more transparency about the consultants taking our feedback into their designs and transparency in general about why the designers picked what they did & what studies they're conducting to ensure LSP is fit for their designs. 

5) I would like to see hydrological mapping and climate change scenarios research done for the park before revitalizing it to establish baselines and identify vulnerabilities. The freshwater marsh in the back of the Nature Center was inundated by Hurricane Sandy and became a brackish pond-- meaning the restoration was a failure. How will you ensure that the positioning and capacity of the ""nature based solutions"" will be enough to meet our needs in the face of climate change? I hear there is reluctance to accommodate gray design (retention basins) and the response that we have ""so much nature based solutions"" we don't need retention basins, but look at NYC and remember Sandy? What data are we making these judgments from? 

6) Also, I don't see hydrology mentioned at all. When altering the topography and terrain with amphitheatres, etc, how are you sure this will not negatively lead to stormwater runoff or unanticipated flooding of park areas? Are there other green infrastructure elements you are considering? Why not permeable pavement and permeable basketball courts? etc. Make a space multifunctional.

7) I would like to see habitat quality and biodiversity studies informed by projected increases of use, density, and traffic.

8) How are you going to ensure the restoration projects are maintained? So many restoration projects are started, but do not receive funding to ensure they are successful. The park staff is microscopic and underpaid, yet this is the highest revenue-generating park. How are you ensuring the longevity and sustainability of this work from an organizational stand point?",alexisizzle@gmail.com

Ashley Metius,,"It's imperative that the new design of Liberty State Park prioritizes serious coastal tidal wetland creation and restoration, while effectively addressing climate change, enhancing resiliency, and protecting critical habitats in this prime location of Jersey City. Due to decades of urbanization, pollution, and habitat degradation, these wetlands have been severely impacted, jeopardizing their ability to function effectively as natural buffers against climate change and sea-level rise. Moreover, the loss of these wetlands has resulted in the decline of essential wildlife populations and compromised the overall health of our coastal ecosystems. By incorporating citizen science and engaging Jersey City schools, we can transform this future restored habitat into an invaluable outdoor classroom, fostering environmental education and instilling a sense of stewardship among our youth.

This project presents a unique opportunity to showcase smart design principles in a flagship state park, demonstrating how sustainable practices can harmonize with nature while meeting the needs of our community. Implementing third-party sustainable rating systems (i.e., Envision, WEDG, LEED) throughout the design and construction processes will ensure that the highest standards of environmental responsibility are upheld, setting a precedent for future development projects.

Let's seize this moment to create a vibrant, resilient, and sustainable Liberty State Park that not only enriches the lives of residents and visitors but also serves as a beacon of environmental leadership for years to come.",ashleymetius@gmail.com
Caroline Parks,,"I, as well as my friends and neighbors are disappointed and concerned about Paul Fireman and Bob Hurley’s repeated attempts to put a “sports and entertainment complex” and “5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue in the park” as quoted in the Jersey Journal, and the JC Times reported that Hurley now wants to increase active recreation from 60 to 85 acres.

Liberty State Park is one of the reasons I moved to Jersey City. It’s so nice there, very nice to see families picnicking in the grass, walking the length of the park. I can’t imagine how awful a huge ugly sports stadium would blot out the sky, like a huge eyesore. Or the parking mess it would create. 

State parks are parks not sports arenas. It’s beauty lies in its abundance of nature, bird watching is so much fun. I go there to recharge. I go there to relax. I love that migratory birds stop there on their way. I’ve seen red wing blackbirds, herons, egrets, ducks, cardinals, chickadee’s etc… Let’s keep Liberty State Park a safe habitat for them. With all the building going on and loss of green space, keeping Liberty State Park as a natural state park is absolutely necessary.

Richard McDermott,,Liberty State Park should be an open and free park with plenty of green space. I and many others are completely opposed to the selfish interest of Paul Fireman and his organization to destroy this green space in order to further line his already overflowing pockets. Please reject this man and his continuous delays and sabotage.,rickmcd@gmail.com
Jill Scipione,,"County parks are being filled with sports fields of artificial turf. Please consider not using these for Liberty State Park. As these artificial fields are flammable they spend much of the time locked up and inaccessible. No one can use them informally.There are no pick up games. There is zero use for the general public. This is highly inappropriate for a State park..

More importantly, artificial turf has many unacceptable and known environmental problems. These are a few from several articles on the subject(I apologize as I am not sure how to include the links):

Artificial turf lasts for eight to 10 years, after which it is typically disposed of in a landfill

Artificial turf does not eliminate the need for water; in some cases, it is irrigated with water in order to temporarily bring down high surface temperatures. 

Maintenance can include treatment with antimicrobials, as well as periodic addition of infill to replace the infill that migrates off the field into the environment.On top of the chemical makeup of artificial turf, it is also impermeable (unlike natural grass). It requires harsh chemicals for cleaning sweat, mucus, spit, blood, bird droppings, etc., that remain on the surface.

 A recent article in Architectural Digest notes that artificial turf’s plastic material “traps heat during the day and holds it through the night, meaning runoff water will leave turf hotter than it would natural grass” - which can have negative effects on aquatic ecology. 

In sunny, warm weather, artificial turf can become much hotter than natural grass, raising concerns of heat-related illness and skin burns for athletes playing on the fields.

While natural grass absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, artificial turf does the opposite by releasing CO2, methane, and a variety of chemicals. Chemical analysis of artificial turf conducted at Yale University found 96 chemicals, 20 percent of them probable carcinogens. In addition, artificial turf contains highly toxic PFAS or “forever chemicals” linked to lower childhood immunity, endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to inhalation, ingestion and dermal absorption, as they are lower to the ground and breathe more quickly.

After years of blowback from parents and environmentalists, some companies are now advertising artificial turf made with “natural infill.” But beware of these greenwashing tactics! These so-called “natural/organic” infills are typically made from silica sand coated with acrylic polymers. These pellets can easily break down into hazardous silica dust – a lung hazard recognized by the EPA as a carcinogen. This is also combined with the breaking down of the acrylic polymer coating into plastic dust and micro-debris. Some “natural” infills are made from cork and coconut, which can easily flake and blow away, leaving a dangerously hard playing surface.

On top of that, no matter how “natural” the infill may be, the plastic green blades that act as “grass” remain a serious environmental and health concern.

As the DEP you are obligated to not further pollute our environment, especially  in a park of all things. And we count on you to also ensure anything that encompasses so many acres that is sited in a state park is usable by the public, not just Jersey City and Hudson County schools and organized teams.

If you ruin the parking, handicapped users would have hardships, if there is an emergency at the marina how can EMS reach them,? If boaters leave and the marina goes bankrupt NJ loses lease money.

Jim Rife,,"At the risk of stating the obvious, LSP is a floodplain. Much of LSP was underwater during Sandy, and with climate change, the flooding will only get more severe and more frequent.

Erin Gromen,,"I think the current plan goes beyond what it needs to do to accommodate so many interests.   A park in the dense urban environment (and only getting more dense) that is Jersey City should prioritize opportunities to enjoy nature and remediate environmental issues, such as our disappearing tree canopy, flooding issues, and disappearing wildlife habitats. We don't need more impermeable surfaces (buildings and parking lots). Also it's a completely cynical argument to say the local community needs more facilities and to propose a private sports and entertainment complex that charges admission fees and will not program to local interests. (Additionally, recreation facilities are fine but not really the domain of a state park.) Anyone who says the park has 'nothing to do' I feel has never been to a park before. I approve of the concessions and vision of NJDEP's plan and hope it can continue to move forward.",erin.gromen@gmail.com
Tara Levy,,"I oppose the proposed football stadium and commercial concert venue to replace the DEP's plan of nature habitats, open spaces and paths.  I support a Central Park type path with as much opportunity as possible to enjoy nature.",taralevy@aol.com
Shankar Kumar,,"I strongly oppose plans to construct a 5000-seat football stadium and 7000-seat concert venue within Liberty State Park (LSP).  Such development would jeopardize ongoing restoration efforts focused on creating a unique urban nature sanctuary. As the only park of its kind accessible to residents of northern New Jersey counties along the Hudson River, LSP offers a vital connection to the natural world.
These proposed developments would cause devastating harm to the park:
1) Disruption of Wildlife:  Increased traffic and noise pollution would severely impact bird populations, including critical migratory routes, and other resident wildlife.
2) Loss of Public Access:   The influx of traffic and crowds will deter the very residents LSP is meant to serve. Those seeking tranquility and nature immersion will be driven away.
3) Missed Opportunities:  The county has countless alternative locations, such as repurposed warehouses, that would allow these venues to thrive without compromising LSP's ecological integrity.
Preserving LSP means preserving a rare and precious resource for both nature and our community. I urge decision-makers to choose a location that allows for development and safeguards this irreplaceable park.",zumba10sk@gmail.com
JordanAnn Tobias,,"The ""coaches"" and ""recreation representatives"" for the children on the south side of Jersey City must not remember that there is an existing sports complex in the south side already for the kids in that area  - CAVEN POINT.

Has no one recommended that an existing sports facility area be enhanced to better fit/suit their needs??  Who are these people really representing?  If they were so interested in the children of this area in Jersey City, why haven't they advocated to have an existing sports complex area build up for their needs?  It's already there, why start from scratch?  
I grew up in Jersey City.  My mother was born and raised here.  Why are you entertaining plans that will destroy this unique and vital open space area just to please a fraction of the population who want to turn Liberty State Park into a giant amusement park?  The city is allowing massive building complexes all over Jersey City.  Why isn't there a requirement to include recreation space in those plans for people who have lived in these neighbor hoods all their lives?  Where is the city and state here?

Michelle Berckes,,"I actually thought the presentation sounded pretty harmless but upon looking at the renderings following the meeting, I truly think this is way too much. It was truly shocking HOW MUCH THIS WILL IMPACT THE OVERALL CALM THIS SPECIAL PARK PROVIDES. 

Jersey city is unique in its habitat because of THIS particular park. The park provides a sanctuary away from the high energy of the city. The wildlife and quiet nooks provide an oasis and a place to escape to. I am all for creating spaces for children to play but as a business owner and resident in this city for over 10 years, I truly believe developing THIS PARTICULAR PLAN WILL CREATE STRESS IN OUR ECO SYSTEM AS JERSEY CITY RESIDENTS. 

THE AMOUNT OF SPACE PROPOSED WILL COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PARK. If there was enough natural preserved space left over I would be on board but this will be a complete takeover and will be an eyesore to this beautiful escape.

It gives the project momentum and shows the public good faith in kicking things along (and perhaps saving the site from takeover).  I appreciate the consideration of all types of activities, kayaking included.  One concern I have is that convenient parking must be carefully considered and I don't believe I saw that on the designs.  I understand the permeability issues with pavement but that could also work in our favor in covering up some of the required environmental remediation areas. I also thought that being able to provide some revenue stream might be great to support the maintenance of fields, tracks etc. but minimally.

Marc Kornutik,,"Have attended all DEP meetings to date, including online today. Overall I approve of plans set forth by the DEP…   YET vehemently oppose the large sports venues proposed by Mr. Fireman’s “people’s park” contingent.  
That said as a LLM Marina tenant was totally disheartened by the minimal changes proposed in alternatives 1, 2 & 3 and minimal discussion on the marina overall. 
Unfortunately your video cut out for the fourth alternative presentation but a friend was able to send it to me.  Thankfully that returned the parking to the mix, but still cannot understand why, that area of the lawn should be used for SUCH a density of “small ball” sports without addressing public parking, pathways & other facilities nearby. 
The vehicle lot for the marina needs to be reserved for its use and preferably fenced from that lawn area. If current lawn area is to be changed for general public their needs need to be met as well, yet I do not see that in any of the revised proposals.

Randall Morton,,"The Notth End: This is the commercial part of the park and you should explore similar opportunities since the infrastructure for those types of uses are already in place.

The Hudson River Walkway, on the edge of the Morris Canal is part of a larger treasured NJ network. Please explore widening this walkway and making it an elegant promenade that also focuses on the city skylines across the waters.
Parking is dynamic (sometimes lots are full, sometimes empty), To best situate parking, assess the needs of all
Park elements, existing and proposed, and have a credible professional perform a Shared Parking Study to determine the best way to reuse some existing Parkin, add new parking, and how much should be remote. 
The concept plans show sports fields shoe-horned in on the north side. What’s missing is all
Of the additional
Land need around those fields to support spectators, athletes in preparation, concessions, safety arrest, and emergency access. When you later in what it takes to not only layout a playing field, but what land is need to support the safe and effective operation of such an ambitious sports center, you will have to conclude that in total, that use doesn’t fit at all in the narrow strip of land on the north side. Option 4, showing courts, for sports like basketball and tennis and pickleball is the only option that looks like it has a realistic chance of fitting.

Shlomit Geisler,,"As a senior I agree that Liberty State Park requires more shade and shelter from the sun.
It is vey difficult to walk there during the summer afternoons.
I suggest planting more trees which could partially solve this issue.

I also think that parking in all areas should be free and accessible to all in the Park.

The Park should retain its' natural beauty and peacefulness as you plan to develop and add recreation and sports space.
There needs to be a balance of  'quiet' space with 'active' space.
We need to  respect and maintain the greatest asset of the park which is  its' sanctuary spirit.

The potential is great for upgrading the park but keep in mind that park space should also be dedicated to honor our need for seeking peace within nature.
My concern is that the park will become very crowded and noisy and we don't want that to happen.

So let's try to think of ways to balance the 'quiet' with the 'more active' space.
Let's keep all the space in the park 'safe'.

The park needs to remain open and lush and full of free recreational areas for the public. The plans in 1A and 1B support this vision and will provide the neighborhood with improvements to our existing space.

Karen Zavian,,"Liberty State Park is a successful space where people come to see, hear, touch, and generally experience all aspects of nature at their leisure.  Any additional athletic and entertainment facilities should only be considered for OUTSIDE LSP limits.  LSP’s purpose has already been defined!  It is the ONLY FREE OPEN AND GREEN SPACE in Jersey City!  It was created for that purpose!  LSP’s precious GREEN OPEN SPACE is its distinction.  It is a gift we have given our citizens and children.  More important than carving up LSP for ball fields, concert venues and other such stadium like facilities, OPEN GREEN SPACE, and the freedoms it engenders, is the most VITAL offering we must continue to maintain!

Moriah Kinberg,,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. A few questions came up for me.

Has a study been done to actually assess the need for recreational space and athletics?  I would suggest actually doing a study to determine the need for athletics before spending billions to implement these fields. There is a football field ""Saint Peter's Prep James F. Keenan, S.J. Field"" next to the park. Was this considered? 

There is another full size football field in Washington Park that was built less than ten years ago and is not well utilized just to name a few. Washington Park is a County park and the football field may not be considered as a field that is available for use by JC students. I would look into this to see if the fields in County parks are accessible to all students in the County. They should be but that needs to be explored. 

We also have an ice skate rink and skating rink in Pershing Field that needs to be repaired. We also have several city parks that are filled with ball parks that are locked and not accessible to the public. 

Additional recommendations: 

1.) Incorporate public transportation into the park and more accessibility. Make the park by design as much as possible less reliant to cars. Pedestrian oriented.

2.) I support the use of all fields that are built out for stormwater management. It is needed and will also assist with addressing stormwater issues. 

3.) Support the nature based amphitheater 

4.) I also support understanding the existing uses of the park and expanding and facilitating the existing. 

5.) Keep as much of the existing plantings and trees and plant more trees and new gardens.  Are there any plans for new plantings, trees, art and nature installations? 

I support the proposed Phase 1 project. Using nature-based solutions to address flooding issues. We need nature based solutions to flooding. This project is a solution to flooding. I am not supportive of the additional athletics with out a study that shows the need based on the number of JC students who play these sports and the existing athletic fields. 

Phase 2

I agree with as much open space and multi-use as possible, especially given that we have several football fields in the City and surrounding areas. 

I do not support locked facilities that privatize the park and limit the use for everyone. 

The needs of the community are not limited to athletics. Jersey City has a recreation department and many opportunities and facilities for sports. This does not mean that there isn't a need but that need can be quantified and decisions should be based on data that includes existing facilities in City and County parks, schools and recreation areas. 

For the Jersey City community that I am a part of, one of the things that we lack is open green spaces. I personally utilize Liberty State Park as a refuge from the built environment that surrounds us. 

There is a massive need for open green space within an extremely built out city. Children in Jersey City need access to nature, open space to play safely, to fly kites, learn how to ride a bike in a space without cars. Areas that are free from development while our city continues to get built out. 

My biggest priority is actually maintaining as much open green space as possible, given the environmental and community benefits. 

I would also suggest making the park more accessible for public transportation and to design the park to be public transit and pedestrian oriented and less car oriented given the environmental benefits of encouraging public transportation. 

There is a lot of talk about bringing additional amenities for the park, like restaurants and food vendors. I would also encourage a study to ensure the economic viability of having additional year-round restaurants. And also suggest a way to encourage people who visit the park to also visit near by areas of Jersey City and for the for the economic benefits to spill over into Jersey City rather than be contained in the park. 

The amphitheater options without bandshell that would obscure the view looks good. Would need to consider accessibility. I would also encourage art installations to go along with the bandshell and other ways to engage with the natural environment. Gardens would be another way to utilize the park and the natural environment.",moriahkinberg@gmail.com

Sasha De Fazio,,"Overall, I'm excited about the revitalization of Liberty State Park. The plans seem like a good mix of passive and active recreation.

I understand some need for athletics, but we should be mindful of what an influx of people will do to the area. We need to be aware of traffic and parking. 

We should continue to focus on nature and ways to incorporate activities into the park that keep it a green space. Canopy improvement is essential. 

Also, driving/walking in the surrounding area is already a disaster. We need to work with Jersey City on traffic violation enforcement and pedestrian safety, especially as this park becomes more of a destination.

This is one of the only opportunities for them to access open space without a significant drive, which is not a reality for most local families. We value the green space, the unobstructed views, the wildlife, the nature trails, and Caven Point. It would be a shame to wipe out such a rare and valued public space with more concrete and noise. I truly believe that is not what those who live and work in this community want.",sarahvanderwerken@gmail.com

Well maintained trails through the Restoration Project Area would be a resource for nature lovers, bird watchers and school children throughout Hudson County.

Reasonable parking close to active use takes into consideration the necessary auto means by which many will use to come and enjoy. Electric charging stations, and bike storage should be considered here as well.
It must also be stated that any active use/community centers in this state park will be available to the larger NJ population as well and not just for Jersey City/Hudson County local residents. Therefore LSP plans should not allow Jersey City municipal government to abdicate responsibility for providing additional active/passive recreational facilities within Jersey City for its residents.",oonajacksonmoore@gmail.com
Anthony Sandkamp,,"50 acres = 37 football fields or other athletic fields (1.3 acres per field) /8 JC high schools= 4.5 per high school
If you create fixed facilities for these fields you negate multipurpose usage. The commission should spend time on summer weekends in the park to observe current usage. The same open field is used for a multitude of purposes if it is left open. When it is built into special purpose it is no longer available for alternate uses. Liberty State park is already the most visited state park in New Jersey. Current uses should be given priority over innovation and local athletic desires. Jersey City athletic fields should be located within walkable distances from each JC neighborhood. There are brown fields in each ward that should be utilized. Open space in this park and its iconic views are the biggest reason it is currently the most visited in the state. Those views and the open space are damaged by creating fixed facilities for athletics.",sandkampww@aol.com

There should be no concert venues, stands or amphitheaters built into the park.  There should never be any idea of putting a casino in thsi park at all.  These types of events/buildings will generate noise polution, create issues with parking, trash and thousands of people coming in disturbing and ruining the neighborhood and the park. This park needs to be accessible to seniors/physically challenged as well as others.  Public transportation needs to be expanded as presently you must walk a long way to get to the park after getting off of the light rail or use a car which many people do not own which has prevented me from visiting the park. This park should remain and needs to be what it is, a park that can be enjoyed by all with benches, picnic areas, passive and active recreation which can be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike but not turned into a commerical venue such as the Meadowlands with all of the issues this brings or privatized for individual or luxury use only..",dm1914@gmail.com

Just as importantly, please de-prioritize auto access and accommodate more efficient transportation into and throughout the park. This land lies in one of the world's most urbanized environments, where the vast majority of people travel by foot or transit.

But most importantly whatever paths you have they have to be designated people walking /motorized bikes. / bikes. They might have to be designed so E BIKES don’t run us over. As it is now it’s not so crowded and wide enough. But please make them wide.  Or separate. Maybe you can make some fields that can be interchangeable. I really liked ideas about the train area having markets and food and the train cars into a restaurant. That would be able to take people back to older days. Just keep the bigger buildings towards back not to get rid of view.  Keep the flat areas that are now the same.  Don’t change the good parts of bbq area. And boat launch is fine as is. Keep it a park. Trees areas. To breath and enjoy air the space. Don’t make buildings. And if you doo keep them green. And low height. With gardens on top. Be creative. I’m not on any task force. But I lived here all my life and love this park.  It’s crazy on July 4th. No one wants that crazy every day.  I really don’t see the necessity for all these ball fields and concert venues. It’s a park. Make it the most beautiful park in the state.   Keep it green. A nature reserve!  Progress doesn’t mean concrete!   Start simple see how it goes.  Thank you.

Joseph Albanese,,"Re: Proposed Privatization of Public Lands at Liberty State Park
I am the public access chairperson for both the Berkeley Strip Club (BSC) and the New Jersey Beach Buggy Association (NJBBA). We are two active groups of anglers from all over New Jerey and support the public’s right to access tidal waterways and their shores anywhere in NJ. We wholeheartedly agree with NJDEP when they say, “The Public Trust Doctrine is the principle that certain resources, in this case tidal waters and shorelines, are preserved for public use, and that the government is required to maintain them for the public's reasonable use.” (NJDEP website, Public Trust Doctrine Ensures Access). This right to access tidal waterways and their shores includes the Liberty State Park shoreline at the Hudson River.
Hudson County is the most densely populated county in New Jersey, and the sixth most densely populated county in the US. It has a population density of 15,961 people per square mile (2020 census). That makes Liberty State Park a recreational oasis for residents in the surrounding areas. While not as fully developed as New York’s Central Park, Liberty State Park is just as unique a greenspace. The views in the park include the NJ Turnpike to the west and an industrial park to the south but turn east and you are greeted with unparalleled views of the Hudson River, the New York Skyline, New York Harbor, and the Statue of Liberty. Where else in NJ do you have open public space with as spectacular a view as that?
The boundaries of Liberty State Park are finite and constrained by the development surrounding it. To take any portion of the park and privatize it is a desecration of the park. Public land taken for private use places that land off-limits to park users except for an elite few. That’s not why Liberty State Park was created. It was meant for everyone to enjoy.
Privatization will also block access to the shoreline of the Hudson River. That violates New Jersey’s long-standing commitment to the public trust. Access for the public not only includes visual access, but also requires both perpendicular access to the water’s edge and parallel access along the shoreline. Using that shoreline access allows the public to walk, fish, sit, or simply stand to enjoy the view. Building private marinas or venue space permanently eliminates public access.
Sports fields, passive recreation areas, picnic areas, and improved access for fishing should be what matters. Not privatization through development that would deny the public access.
It is also important to point out that the Hudson River is second only to Chesapeake Bay as a spawning ground for striped bass. Stripers are anadromous, meaning they live their adult life in saltwater but spawn in freshwater including the Hudson River as far north as Troy, NY. As those fish enter and exit the Hudson during the spring and fall runs, they swim along the New Jersey shore of the river and can be caught from the shore or piers extending into the river.
People fish not just for the chance to catch a striped bass, a true pelagic predator, but they catch stripers to feed their families. Any reduced fishing access, literally, takes food off people’s tables. The state needs to increase fishing access at Liberty State Park to better serve the needs of local residents.
Senator Scutari and Assemblyman Coughlin both represent areas with high population densities and highly industrialized areas along the Arthur Kill, portions of Raritan Bay and the Raritan River. Both Raritan Bay and the Raritan River are well known fisheries among anglers. I would think both the Senator and the Assemblyman would look to improve and expand access to tidal waterways in their respective districts instead of looking to take away access at Liberty State Park.

Lorraine Freeney,,"As an environmental advocate and nature lover, I support the DEP’s plans and strongly oppose the alternate plan touted by Bob Hurley. Liberty State a park should not become a massive entertainment complex. Active recreation has its value and is provided for in the DEP plan. But Liberty State Park is vital as a place where people of all ages and all income levels can engage in interactive recreation - walking, birding, nature hikes, picnicking, and more. I have personally led students on bird walks and nature hikes, and seen their interest blossom in ecology and conservation.  Not all young people play team sports. Not all who do play sports would even benefit from a stadium such as the one proposed by Bob Hurley and his ilk. Liberty State Park is vital for the hundreds of bird species (documented on eBird) and other wildlife who live in and travel through the park. But it is also vital for the humans who benefit from it and rely on it for their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

Lucia Marchese,,"Thinking along with a massive botanical garden … think of it as an enchanted pathway where there are separate biking and walking trails … look at the Japanese gardens in San Francisco and the Brooklyn botanical for inspiration… I would make it so that there are little rest stops along the way … a small beer garden, a tea house, an ice cream shop.  There could be a skate ramp area… a few bocce courts… perhaps even a few more of those exercise stops like areas to do various things like pull ups etc.  and then there could be an ampetheater for various acts and music… a small museum … a kids area for discovering nature … a manned nature center.  Sculpture throughout.  However I would steer away from athletic fields that use massive swaths of space and only a small amount of people can use them at any time.

Gregg Lehmberg,,"I’m writing to express my deep concern regarding the plan to develop artificial turf (a.k.a. plastic grass) athletic fields in Liberty State Park rather than using natural grass surfaces. The issues with plastic grass are numerous, despite the natural appearance of the plastic carpet.

Climate Change

Plastic grass is primarily produced from the fossil fuel ethane which is extracted from the earth via fracking. The fracking process itself releases methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pollutes ground water and soil.

Plastic grass contributes to climate change by off-gassing carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in perpetuity once they are produced. Surfaces that are blanketed in plastic grass form heat islands by absorbing radiation from the sun and get as least as hot as asphalt with temperatures often exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

Simultaneously, these plastic surfaces replace a natural grass ecosystem which acts as a carbon sequestration system, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere rather than adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Natural grass surfaces also remain cool during hot weather compared to the blistering hot temperatures of plastic grass surfaces.

Health Implications

The plastic grass blades contain many toxic chemical additives including plasticizers, dyes, heavy metals, and Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). These materials are known and suspected carcinogens, toxins, endocrine disrupting compounds and respiratory irritants.

The infill used to keep the blades of grass propped up is most commonly crumb rubber produced from used tires. The crumb rubber contains an even greater number of toxic substances including volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. The pungent smell coming off these fields on even a mild day is adequate proof that the local environment is being polluted with these toxic gases.

The immune systems of children and adolescents are not fully developed, making them more susceptible to negative health outcomes from exposures to these chemicals. Higher risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion from the excessive temperatures mentioned previously is an additional health concern.
It is well documented that there is an elevated risk of certain non-contact lower body injuries on artificial turf as well. This has been highlighted by several high-profile injuries in professional football in recent years.

Environmental Contamination

Typical fields consist of tens of thousands of pounds of plastic carpet and hundreds of thousands of pounds of infill, usually crumb rubber made from used tires. These materials break down and thousands of pounds migrate into the local environment each year, contaminating soil and water with toxic chemicals and micro plastic pollution. The carpet and infill only last about 10 years and there are currently no recycling facilities to deal with these materials. Inevitably, they end up in landfills or are incinerated. Either destination leads to further climate, environmental, and health impacts.

This is just a sampling of the issues related to plastic grass and would seem to be in direct opposition to the NJDEP’s Green Acres mission of ‘preserving and enhancing NJ’s natural environment’.

Cost of Ownership
There is one final point that I think is highly relevant and that is one of cost. The total cost of ownership for plastic grass is typically two to three times higher than natural grass fields, even when considering the added cost of an athletic field manager and proper organic maintenance.

Natural grass athletic fields designed for sports activity and maintained organically by an experienced athletic field manager can offer safe, durable playing surfaces without the negative aspects of artificial turf highlighted above.  New Jersey cannot afford to sacrifice any more natural space to these toxic plastic fields. The Climate, Health, and Environmental impact are too significant to justify their proliferation.",woodcraftergregg@aol.com

When was the last time they did that and do they want to do that?  If the billionaire developers want these billion dollar projects why don't they spend their billions of dollars buying some land and putting them there.    The public is being divided to misinformation and we should all be working together to make liberty State Park the best that it can be.

Laura Uhlig-Smith,,"The sports fields:
  The proposed map shows these fields right next to the bulkheads on the marina. This area floods regularly. If these are artificial turf fields that would be building impervious surfaces in a flood zone. With that being said, artificial turf has so many toxins, and should not be used next to any water body, as it leaches microplastics, and various chemicals into the environment. The Hudson is polluted enough already. In addition, artificial turf grass is costly and high maintenance. It has to be replaced every 7-8 years. Repeated exposure to salt water may make it deteriorate quicker. Please build these fields more inland, and use real turf grass, not artificial.",laurauhlig@yahoo.com
Tim Cornelissen,,"The current plan that the DEP is implementing is a good one and should not be meaningfully modified. It strikes a balance between nature, recreation, and community. Leaving a lot of area for green space and water will provide better defense against flooding, which will only become more important as climate change increases the occurrence of extreme precipitation. LSP should remain as accessible to the public as possible, and not be turned into a space where private entities can use it to make a profit.

Alternative plans, such as the addition of a golf course, stadium, and music venue, will take away green space and just add more asphalt, concrete, and traffic jams.",misterchimp@gmail.com
Eva Korzan,,"If someone would sit and observe people casually using the park, you would notice that many people borrow CITI bikes from outside the park to enjoy the park. There needs to be instead of more parking, more bike rental options. It's a changing world and younger people are not driving...They want infrastructure that allows people to not drive. Jersey City should look at how NYC has built its coastal parks... parking is not part of the consideration. We are not Asbury... we are more like the Brooklyn Bridge park.

Open space is desperately needed here, and the park is a valuable escape valve for people who are surrounded daily with closely-packed people, traffic, construction and noise, with little relief.  I support the improvements to the unused portions of the park, but it goes without saying that the least construction of intrusive elements including buildings and dedicated sports fields is the ideal.  Please do not make the park another public place that locks out the majority of folks who want to enjoy the open space, broad fields, sky and water that are available here and nowhere else in northern New Jersey.

I understand managing public spaces with a wide variety of uses and users.  
I implore the task force to follow DEP guidance on this park plan.  LSP can be so much more connected and integrated into the surrounding communities without becoming dominated by the commercial venue proposals and traffic.  While I understand the need for some athletic fields it’s important to note that these fields would only be used seasonally while trails, bike paths, and the great views of LSP can be enjoyed year-round.  
I think we are selling our community and youth short by pretending that more limited use fields and indoor stadiums will somehow serve them better.

I was also able to celebrate my 30th birthday with a picnic in Liberty state park during the covid-19 pandemic, when it wasn’t safe to gather with loved ones indoors. And I even got engaged in Liberty State Park. Liberty State Park has been such a big part of my life because it has been free and open to the public. I want future generations to have this same opportunity to create memories in Liberty State Park as a free public park. I’ve also been aware of repeated attempts by billionaire Paul Fireman to buy parts of the park for his ultra-exclusive golf course for millionaires. Indeed, many of the groups with a purported interest in Liberty State Park, such as the so-called People's Park Foundation and Liberty State Park for All, have received significant funding from Fireman. I stand with the Friends of Liberty State Park. I want to strongly oppose large-scale commercialization of the park, particularly the proposed Sports and Entertainment Complex with a 5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue. I want to support the preservation of the park as a public park, free and open to the public. I also support the NJDEP’s concept for a healthy mix of passive and active recreation, which does include basketball courts and soccer fields and other sports fields for safe spaces for our local youth.

Donald Bender,,"Liberty State Park is a green oasis located adjacent to the massive high-rise buildings of Jersey City, the New Jersey Turnpike a major residential development and a golf course. The park has already, for many years now, been serving its intended purpose of being ... a park! A park is a place that provides relief from the development (and over-development) around it. It provides open space for recreation of all sorts. This beautiful, waterfront park already fulfills its intended role as a park by providing recreational opportunities to a diverse group of park goers. What, exactly, does the park offer to visitors today? Here are just a few of the activities park visitors are presently participating in: walking; running; fishing; cycling; picnicking; kayak tours; bird watching; environmental education; boat launching; viewing the historic railroad terminal; taking the boat to Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty; nature walks; visiting the Empty Sky memorial; and much more. Park visitors come from Jersey City, from elsewhere in the state, and from across the nation as well as overseas.
The park is a gem within this highly urbanized, highly-developed (I would say, over-developed) dense urban region. The last thing residents of Jersey City, and the region need, is more development here. The park should remain the unspolied oasis that it is today.",benderdesign@hotmail.com
Mary Mahony,,"We live is Scotch Plains and have been coming to Liberty State Park since the 70’s when Morris Pesin would speak at intermission of the concerts touting the park and reminding the Jersey City residents when th ebu woild be leaving.
The fact that we travel to LSP from Union county speaks to its universal appeal to all residents of NJ as a state park and as an  oasis of calm in an urban setting. 
It is unfortunate the Fineman’S organization has been successful in creating an us v. them mentality. As LSP is large piece of state property in  Jersey City, it is tempting to try to solve some of Jersey City recreational deficiencies caused by their poor planning, land grabs for developers and use of funds for other projects.  
As a guest in their city, LSP can provide more recreational activities while maintaining the open space, walking paths and nature preserves.
I believe the DEP’s plan provides that with the 60 acres of ball fields. Some further tweaking needs to be done.  For example, the three fields and parking by marina is crowded.
Fireman’s group claims to be for the children of Jersey City, but a 5,000 seat football stadium is beyond the needs of school and league athletics. And a 7,000 seat concert venue is also unnecessary.  There are other places in Jersey city for music.
I feel maintaining the park is an uphill uphill battle against the moneyed interests.  Sadly in NJ money talks.  Just look at Tammy Murphy’s run for Senate and Gov Murphy’s less than strong support for the concept of a people's park.  
The fireman people in the planning committee don’t seem to want to compromise.  I thought that was the purpose of the committee.
It’s as though Fireman didn’t get his land swap for his golf course and changed direction. Just watched all the planning going on over the last years,  hired Bob Hurley  (A brilliant move) and is is just watching the grass roots fight until he can get his plan implemented with a money drop and perhaps a more pliable DEP commissioner when the administration changes.

Jim Geist,,"Hello, 
The plan for Liberty State Park put forth by Commissioner Shawn LaTourette and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is a fair and balanced plan. I do not feel that Liberty State Park land should be subverted to suite Jersey City's recreation needs which resulted due to years of poor planning by Jersey City Government. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection have gone out of their way to add sport fields to a state park to accommodate Jersey City. No additional acreage from Liberty State Park should be cannibalized for active recreation.
Please put an end to the constant drives to add stadiums, a community center, and an amphitheater to again a STATE park. These are all venues that are costly to build and costly to maintain. And my fear is seeing pools, amphitheaters, and even playing fields, fall into disrepair when state money gets tights and cuts are made and these facilities should not get turned over to commercial or private interests to maintain and run. Just restore the land within Liberty State Park to th natural habitats with walking trails as envisioned in the plan.

Anne Poole,,"These comments are submitted on behalf of the Board of Directors of the New Jersey Environmental Lobby (NJEL).  NJEL is a 51-year-old organization headquartered in Trenton that is focused on protecting New Jersey’s natural resources.  For decades, NJEL has supported the efforts of park advocates to protect the integrity of Liberty State Park (LSP) as a public oasis of open space in the most densely populated and industrialized area of the State.  It is the most unique of New Jersey state parks, integral to both its natural and urban surroundings, as well as well as to the vibrant, historic New York/New Jersey waterways.  In addition, it has historic and cultural significance to the descendants of the indigenous inhabitants. 

We are grateful to the Department of Environmental Protection for initiating the remediation and development of the remaining acreage of LSP, and to the legislative and nonprofit advocates who have championed it for decades.  A development plan for LSP must increase the free, healthy recreational opportunities available to visitors while protecting the ecology of the area.  It must respect LSP’s position within view of, and as a gateway to, the Statue of Liberty Monument, and recognize that many visitors travel to LSP not for recreation, but for inspiration.   Development of additional park acreage must be achieved without burdening Jersey City neighborhoods with additional traffic and pollution.  For all of these reasons, the Board of Directors of NJEL opposes any ticketed-entry or indoor mass entertainment facilities at this state park.  We also urge that New Jersey Transit become an active partner with NJDEP in this project.   Marketing surveys and other outreach should be conducted to determine what public transit enhancements would (1) make the park more  accessible to persons who do not have automobiles and (2) encourage public transit as an alternative to private vehicles.  Public transit service should also be part of a strategy to reduce the need for additional traffic and parking acreage within the Park.

Since the establishment of LSP, there has been a succession of schemes for privatization and commercialization.  All of them led to public outcries.  DEP’s concept for the remediation of the interior acreage appeared to be protection for the Park, at last.  Now, it appears that special interests have again emerged with proposals to privatize portions of this public asset.  NJEL urges that ticketed-entry and mass entertainment venues that would limit the quiet enjoyment of visitors and reduce areas for low impact recreation be excluded from the design.  Such development is contrary to the concept of public parks for the public.  It would reduce open space acreage, restrict public access and change the character of the Park in a highly negative way.  Venues for thousands of customers would require additional parking, adding impervious surfaces and vehicle emissions.  Suggestions that entertainment and sports facilities would generate revenue for the State of New Jersey may be enticing from a State budget perspective, but they fail to mention that private entities have an interest in promoting such development.

 LSP is a park of state-wide significance, not only because of the iconic nature of the site, but also because its fate will set a precedent for the other state parks and forests. Those sites will become targets for schemes that will restrict public access and damage the environments.  State parks and forests are public assets and should be managed for the benefit of all the public.  Thank you for your consideration of our comments.",njel@earthlink.net

Johannes Russek,,"Liberty State Park as it is now provides one of very few opportunities of uncommercial, public space open to leisure activities near the city for individuals and families alike. Walking along the water, sitting on the lawns, flying kites or having a BBQ in a large public space are an exceptionally rare thing to have right near a city like New York. 
What makes this so wonderful is this open space right next to the natural reservations: I have spent many hours bird watching and photographing insects in the perimeter.
I am very worried that any developments like the ones proposed would ruin this rare gem.

Ann Schnakenberg,,"Dear Design Task Force, NJ State Leaders, and Legislators,
   These are my comments on Liberty State Park Phase 1B: Northern Area Recreation, Arts & Culture and Liberty State Park Phase 2: Holistic Long-Term Master Plan.
    We need you to step up and do the right thing. Save Liberty State Park from recreational overdevelopment. Protect this special oasis of public natural open space. There is none like it in our overcrowded state. Do everything you can to stop the recreational over-development of Liberty State Park. This is a matter of environmental justice and equity, and also one of public health. People need nature and the physical and mental health benefits that passive recreation provides, just as much as active recreation, maybe even more so. The pandemic made this clear. 
   The problem is there's not enough nature to go around in our state and it's distribution is far from equitable. Unfortunately, regular people who have a right to pursue simple activities like walking, breathing in, and experiencing natural surrounding don't have ambassadors and lobbyists to represent them the way that organized special interest groups do. We have to rely on people like you to protect the interests of people like us. This is why I'm urging you to do the right thing.
   Say no to sports stadiums, concert venues, unfair admission fees, unnecessary traffic, and anything that restricts public access to this wonderful natural treasure.
   Say yes to the DEPs Revitalization Plan, urban open space, and the liberty of free public access to the natural habitats of Liberty State Park the physical and mental health benefits it can provide if properly protected.
   Once again I urge you to do the right thing.
   Yours,

Lawrence Higgs,,"I was in LSP today and saw plenty of people enjoying the park as a park. While I support the concept to build athletic fields to serve the adjoining neighborhoods, I do NOT. Support the plan to build a mega complex of stadiums and amphitheaters and other commercial facilities. Those facilities exist already at the Meadowlands and at the Prudential Center. I support the DEP are development as it has been proposed with minor modifications for bike lanes and safe pedestrian access from adjoining neighborhoods. As a resident of Jersey City and the state I oppose any plan that calls for monetization of the park.
Once it is paved over and developed,
It is gone forever. Do not be swayed by Coach Hurley and the paid minions of Paul Freeman. Is goal is to for the state into selling Caven Point so he can expand his golf course.

Emily Anderson,,"I strongly support the plans presented by the NJ DEP, particularly the focus on natural preservation and restoration in the central sector of the park.  The holistic revitalization program strikes an excellent balance between the many interests in Liberty State Park.  With increasing impacts of climate change, creating a permeable tidal wetland to absorb storm surges and provide vital natural habitat in the highly urbanized New York metro area benefits both people and nature.  The natural areas also provide numerous opportunities for passive recreation and increased community engagement in the natural world - from school field trips to nature-watching and nature-based programming.  And the mix of community space and athletics facilities provide a great mix of year-round space for the broader region.  The DEP has crafted a well designed and attractive proposal that will surely win international awards when built!

Having attended multiple open houses and community engagement on the park by the DEP, I have been impressed by the level of community engagement, professionalism, and balance that the designers have shown.  The entire process has been both transparent and responsive to community feedback.

By comparison, the privately-funded counter-proposals for the park, involving vast massive event venues and fantastical national-scale elite athletics facilities, are crassly inappropriate for a public state park.  There are many private locations in New Jersey, with much better transportation links, that could site such venues.  Such proposals for commercialization of the park are a crass attempt to subvert the voice of the community for private benefit, and completely ignore the voice of the community while furthering narrow private interests.

Nycha Knowles,,"Dear DEP,

Imagine a future where LSP isn't a playground for billionaires, but a sanctuary for wildlife and a shield against climate threats.

Don't let short-sighted greed pave over this precious green space. We need LSP to be a spongy buffer, absorbing rainwater that would otherwise flood our streets and homes. Replacing this natural defense with concrete stadiums and amphitheaters is like building sandcastles before the tide.

Look to Manhattan, a city desperate for even a sliver of green, and see the value of tiny forests. They're not waiting - their first tiny forest is coming on April 6th! We can do better - we have LSP and the space to plant a whole network of tiny forests, creating a vibrant urban oasis.

Please let us not repeat the mistakes of the past. We need LSP to be a living testament to our commitment to a sustainable future, not another monument to fleeting profits.

Please Please Please say no to stadiums. Say yes to tiny forests, vibrant wildlife refuges, and a greener, more resilient Jersey City.

Erin Boehmer,,"As a sailboat owner in Liberty Landing Marina and Jersey City resident, I'm still concerned with the limited parking for marina tenants due to the proposed addition of a football field, track field, and baseball diamond. Boat owners need to be able to carry supplies (tools, materials, sails, rigging, groceries, etc.) to and from their vessels. They also need to be able to park their cars while on overnight trips. Removing sufficient parking spaces for the marina tenants should be a non-starter. 

I am also concerned about the noise and lights produced by recreation fields. This disrupts the peace of the boating community, many of whom stay aboard on weekends. You seem to be grouping activities that are not similar; an ergonomic flaw in your park design. The quiet peacefulness of boating shares very little with the loud raucous of sporting events. Please do not ruin the calm that so many Jersey City resident boaters enjoy in Liberty Landing Marina.",erin.boehmer@gmail.com
Sarah Gill,,"I am concerned about the outlandish plans being pushed by the People's Park Foundation that will irrevocably damage Liberty State Park. The park has been a critical refuge for residents, visitors, and wildlife for generations.

I was eager to hear the DEP's recommendations to create wildlife sanctuaries, hiking trails, community rec. fields, an outdoor amphitheater, and a restored cultural center at the old train station. Unfortunately, Commissioner LaTourette had to cancel his big community event because Paul Fireman's associates at the People's Park Foundation and LSP4All were apparently unhappy that private developers wouldn't get the chance to build massive stadiums and generate revenue from a public resource.

This park is an important part of my local community and I will vociferously advocate for every inch of Liberty State from Caven Point to the northern tidal basin to be protected from commercialization and overdevelopment. Liberty State should be a free, open, and accessible part of our community that balances the needs of conservation and outdoor recreation.

I join all the voices in New Jersey opposing the overdevelopment promised by the People's Park Foundation and Liberty State 4 All. Please do no let a billionaires greed ruin yet another great resource in our state.

Under the leadership of Commissioner Shawn LaTourette, the NJ DEP's very sensible and accommodating plan provides 60 acres of free, non-commercial recreational areas for youth, as well as equally important areas where local children can connect with nature and engage in STEM educational programs. Since the proposed North Athletics Hub is a stop-gap measure that is unlikely to please anyone, it seems more sensible to keep such structured athletic fields within the 60-acre area designated for these sports. Open and unstructured recreation would be more appropriate in a such narrow confine, with a treed promenade and benches overlooking the Morris Canal Basin. 

It was heartening to listen to statements made by elected officials and community members alike, who had waited many hours for their chance to be heard during the Task Force meeting.

Stephen Ellis,,"As the former Superintendent of Liberty State Park few people would know better than I that this park must stay open and free forever. I have witnessed millions of people enjoy this park from every country imaginable. It not only represents the State of New Jersey, but the entire USA. In the most densely populated state, it provides open space for humanity to restore itself. 
No one person should ever be given the authority to determine the use of this land. If that ever did happen it would be no different than allowing our country to be ruled by a dictator. Restore the interior for trails and wildlife habitats, restore and preserve the train sheds, and restaff the park.

Matthew Rosenhein,,"I am a lifelong resident of northern New Jersey and a three year resident of Jersey City - I can remember visiting Liberty State Park in conjunction all the way back to my childhood trips to the Science Center. I've been following the DEP revitalization plans for years now, and have attended multiple public comment sessions including the meeting of the planning task force on March 2nd.  

The park as it exists is an enormous achievement - and it holds enormous potential for the current users of the park and the generations to come. I oppose in in the strongest possible terms the use of Liberty Park in ways that would lead to commercialization - this includes the construction of any permanent built structures that could be used for paid sporting events or concerts¹. The first priority of the DEP should be to ensure that the shoreline, wetlands and landfill are managed responsibly to ensure future use and protection from storms and tidal events. The second should be stewarding the available land for the best interests of the public now and in the future. And lastly should be making the land available best suited to serving the needs of the public with space and amenities² befitting an urban environment within the second largest city in the state of New Jersey. 

So far I have found the the plans proposed by the DEP to be in line with these priorities - and support the continued efforts of the DEP to engage the public in the pursuit of bringing these plans to fruition. 

¹ The current plans do include renders of a possible amphitheater configurations, which I support the pursuit of. Whether a public serving theater / stadium could ever exist in the park I have genuine uncertainty, but as a reference point for the Task Force, the NYC Delacorte theater was created *after* many years of successful staging of the Shakespeare festival and Shakespeare in the park on _temporary staging_ erected by the primordial Public Theater. There is no non-commercial group, non-profit NGO or otherwise that has demonstrated the need for such a space. 
² Before Jersey City looks to DEP for construction of built sporting facilities they need to finish exhausting the resources they have - the Charlie Heger Ice Rink, the large untapped resources of Lincoln Park, including the poor land use of the Skyway Golf Course, the yet developed land adjacent to Droyer's Point (where the city demolished their existing stadium) and more. The DEP cannot bend to interests who proclaim that only Liberty Park can meet these needs as a backdoor towards funding these needs through revenue producing facilities. 

Post Scriptum - It is a shame that Liberty Park as it exists is not better connected to the city, and that as much of the area at its perimeter is taken up by surface parking lots as exists today. Though it is too late to route the HBLR closer to the park entrance, I encourage the DEP and Jersey City Council to explore any and all possible ways to encourage easier public access to the park interior including moving bike-share docks into the park interior, better routing bike paths from the exterior of the park to the interior, or even the creation of additional shuttles or other non-single occupancy vehicular transit from either HBLR or the city core to the park interior.",matthew.rosenhein@gmail.com

As a Jersey City parent, I feel deeply fortunate that my two young children have access to one of the best natural resources in the country – Liberty State Park.

I want to make sure future generations get to do so as well.

I strongly support the Liberty State Park revitalization plan which would safeguard our environment, upgrade park infrastructure, increase recreational opportunities, and boost quality of life. 

I commend the DEP’s plans to open up and revitalize more areas of the park. It is critical that the revitalization plan preserves the park for our densely populated area and state residents, rather than catering to those who want to profit from it. 

The Liberty State Park revitalization plan is a chance to ensure that this historically significant site has a strong future, including initiatives that will clean up pollution and complete ecological restoration. We are obligated to do everything possible to safeguard our planet, protect biodiversity, and increase quality of life for all. 

The plan also seeks to grow the park’s offerings, from new trails and multi-purpose athletic fields, to educational programs and cultural events.

New and improved amenities such as playgrounds, pathways, public areas, picnic tables, restrooms, and signage will make visiting our beloved Liberty State Park an even greater experience for the millions of folks who do so each and every year. 

Having been created in direct partnership with our residents, this transformative project and process continues to be community-centric, all the way through. 

I am optimistic that this collaborative and environmentally-conscious approach will serve as a model for how we continue to improve our cities and our world.

I am also grateful for the work of community members and activists who have fought so hard for decades to ensure that Liberty State Park remains an oasis for all residents of Jersey City, the Eighth Congressional District and our State.

I look forward to spending countless weekends with my family and neighbors at the revitalized Liberty State Park and know it will continue to serve our communities well for generations to come.

But, one area that we should be cautious to not overdevelop is Liberty State Park.  We should keep that area pristine.  There are not many open spaces like that left, and once they are gone, they are gone forever.

Anonymous Anonymous,,"Liberty State Park is a treasure to the Hudson County, NJ and to the NYC area.  Adding track fields and baseball fields would take away so much value from the local and regional community.   Liberty State Park is beautiful.

Liberty State Park is a treasure and should be protected against sports fields (including baseball fields) and recreational facilities (including spaces for track and field).

Shantal Henry,,"After reviewing Phase 1B plans for Liberty State Park, I can say I am excited to see recreational spaces available for everyone to participate in. In addition, I also look forward to a shuttle service that can increase accessibility between different locations within the park for those who do not rely on personal vehicles for transportation. 

In this Phase 1B I would like to see consideration and implementation of ethical and environmentally friendly materials for these recreational spaces. Most importantly, not using turf or similar synthetic materials for football, soccer, and baseball spaces. Long know to cause adverse health effects as well as infamous for being present in predominately black neighborhoods, turf and similar synthetic materials must be prohibited for use in Liberty State Parks Revitalization. As a born and raised Jersey City resident I would like to live in a place where a standard is set in how the health of the community trumps profit, ease, and all-around shortcuts when it comes to development.

Regarding transportation, for people who need additional accessibility needs, I would like to see the shuttle service be a reliable method of transportation within the park. This would mean that if a family or even an individual wants to see all that the park has to offer they can easily park in one of the parking lots for as long as needed and then rely on the shuttle service for interior transportation. I also look forward to the parks development of this interior shuttle service as a means to reduce the need for cars in the park. If the parks revitalization increases daily park attendance the chance for traffic issues could also increase. However, an adequate shuttle service could overall avoid this traffic issue and ensure that families and individuals feel secure and safe as pedestrians.

Overall, I would like to see Liberty State Park remain a beacon of peace and serenity in Jersey City. Hearing of a potential football stadium and concert venue has made me concerned that this initial Phase 1B development plan is not an end to the parks development but a stepping stone into a much more devastating future of this park that I already love and adore so much. As any other person, I enjoy concerts and stadiums and as a consumer of this activity I am also keenly aware of how development of such structures can destroy many facets of the communities that host them. 

A 5000 seat football stadium and a 7000 seat commercial concert venue would have no place in Liberty State Park. The environmental disruption of the habitat that has been preciously cared for, the possible noise and environmental pollution for the communities around the park (which are predominantly black), the obvious need for parking to accommodate these huge facilities, and the price to access the events held at these venues. None of these things have the community in mind. The “community” that is so frequently mentioned in the promotion of this revitalization plan will most likely be negatively impacted by the addition of these two venues in Liberty State Park. 

If there is one thing I truly would like to have prohibited is the use of concrete which will most likely be needed in excess to produce construction of the venues. Jersey City, especially the site of the park is heavily at risk for flooding. There is no doubt now and science has proven that we are greatly at risk for catastrophic flooding events. The pure simplicity of it is that concrete will be the nail in the coffin for this area. Concrete is known to increase flooding in places prone to it. Keeping the park as a strictly green space is the only way forward to prevent flooding. To spend millions of taxpayer dollars for venues that may not even make it for the next 20 years and may require even more tax dollars to remedy is insulting to all who live here. 

I strongly support that flood prevention and nature preservation take the lead when it comes to developing the park. I am not scientist, preservationist, activist. I am just a citizen who frequents the park even as it stands today. I couldn’t ask for a better park. I would’ve never asked for a better park. Seeing the plans for Phase 1B has opened my eyes. And I can see that the eyes of others, who have extreme and dangerous plans, like Paul Fireman and his surrogates, have opened too. However, I strongly encourage that the eyes of those deciding the future of the park open to possibility of keeping the park safe, peaceful, unencumbered by greed and instead remain a beacon of nature and preservation for all future generations to enjoy.

Ellen Quinn,,"Dear Planners, Commissioners, State Representatives:

I am a resident of Jersey City having arrived just before 911 occurred. On that day, I was taking my morning walk in Liberty State Park as the attack occurred and stayed to help emergency responders.  The experience of national and personal disaster, viewed with many Jersey City neighbors from the LSP shore will be with me for life, as if it occurred just yesterday.  Fortunately, my time at LSP is also filled with thrilling sightings of all manner of birds––the park is on the migratory flyway from South America!—some of the early sightings of seals in the harbor and, the most charming: Fourth of July fireworks where it is possible to appreciate the great ethnic, racial, cultural diversity in our city.  It is a fantastic amenity for residents of New Jersey and most especially, those of Jersey City. For a crowded urban environment, we really don’t have much variety in the open space available to us--young and old. 

I am writing to support your fine work on revitalizing the park with its thoughtful mix of active sports areas and also generous accommodation for passive enjoyments, such as I note above.  The park is where we can see our diverse community, which serves a vital civic need, and it does double duty as a place for enjoyment of nature and family. For many, it is also a sanctuary for more private reflection and calm. 

I am also writing to register my opposition to the petition for commercial accommodation of a sports stadium and arena. No! Though the State is planning for lots of public acreage, the plans for commercializing a large area for high volume traffic, professional entertainments, and commercial interests will not be an experience of addition for those who use/need the park, such as more options and more fun. The commercial arena and stadium will be an experience of subtraction that will degrade the more intimate community experience found in the park and which has always been provided. Ambitious commercialization plans for a mass audience is incongruent with the civic purpose of the park. Yes, the park is home to a restaurant, a marina, music events, races, and large organized community events. None of these diminish the experience of the park for its users. Rather, these scaled amenities and events highlight the grand vistas, open fields, and beauty of Liberty State Park. To me, the new petition for large building projects and parking lots to accommodate mass entertainment is out of scale and out of character with the park. And let’s acknowledge that they could be accommodated anywhere that has an off-ramp from a highway. 

Thank you for considering my appeal and for the public option to be heard.

Sophie Rupp,,I oppose Paul Fireman's proposition of an entertainment complex (and any and all efforts to privatize and privately profit from our community's state park).

Gene Stoveken,,"Thank you for allowing comments on the future of LSP.  I am  in favor with most of the current DEP plans for the future beauty of LSP.  As an avid park user , from walking and biking for my health while enjoying the beauty of the park, there are a few upgrades I think would benefit all users .  First would be some more family friendly concession food options . The restaurants near the marina are to overpriced , plus not really menu friendly for a family of 4 with small children to enjoy.  2nd addition I would like to see is a   Covered stage  for concerts that also has permanent electricity with lighting . The current Sunday summer concert series has a same day uncovered stage setup  with gas powered generators for power. A covered stage could also lead to more concerts of various music genre’s along with possible theatrical performances .  One thing the park DOES NOT need is large scale stadiums , this will lead to traffic jams in and around the park , and would destroy the peace and tranquility families and individuals seek when enjoying the park . If I want to enjoy traffic jams and staring at concrete and metal buildings all I have to do is exit the park from jersey Ave and there it is for all to see .",Estoveken@comcadt.net
Rachel Emmet,,"We need a park, as in GREEN SPACE, not more sports facilities or stadiums or paved areas. A space with lush trees, lakes, meadows, so our eyes can look at something other than buildings all the time. Brooklyn doesnt have to fight to not pave prospect park, Manhattan doesnt have to keep explaining why central park needs trees. Why do we have to keep attending meeting after meeting after meeting to protect our green spaces in Jersey City? I'm sick of having to write these comments and I'm sick of having to attend these meetings. The environmental center, caven point, Lincoln Park West nature trail - these are the only little slices of nature that Jersey City has. I am an avid bird watcher and I would love more Meadows grasslands ponds trees to see more wildlife to have a respite for us to enjoy.  If we don't give people nature to enjoy, how will they ever learn to protect and cherish nature??   We have treated the meadowlands and natural areas around us like its a dumping ground for sports facilities, giant warehouses, golfcourses, or literal landfills instead of the important environmental spaces they are. Enough is enough. Keep the park GREEN.",rachelemmet@gmail.com
Zihui Yang,,Liberty State Park is the largest publically accessible green space and recreational area that is easily accessible by residents of Jersey City and surrounding areas.

Glenn Philen,,"Spending time in nature is the greatest inspiration and blessing that we have in this world, and the people of Jersey City have a paradise in the current Liberty State Park, where we can enjoy the grass and trees, kayaking and sailing on the water, and walking, running, and bicycling through a revitalized forest with the best view of New York in the world.

If we want this park to exist for our grandchildren, then we must protect it and maintain it as the special place that it is. Plans to develop and ""enhance,"" this beautiful park are misguided at best, and corrupt and destructive at worst. Instead of a beautiful meadow, we will be left with decaying infrastructure once it has outlived it's usefulness and the nature will be gone. Peaceful park goers will be replaced with crowds from the city clogging up JC infrastructure. 

Not only that, but developing this land is a slippery slope - look at the areas around other NY / NJ area sporting complexes. There is no way for major league sporting stadiums and the other development plans for the park to co-exist with nature. Build a stadium, and you can be guaranteed the rest of the park will be poured over with concrete.  

Imagine what Central Park would be like if Citi Field (a great place to watch a game) had been built in the middle? When would the development stop? (A: Never). We will lose much more than we gain if these plans are allowed to proceed. 

I humbly ask you to stop all plans for unsustainable destruction and privatization of the park. It is the most valuable free land in New Jersey for a reason, and we should keep it free and for use by the public, not for private enterprise.",gphilen@gmail.com

I’ve run in LSP almost every morning with my dog, sled and built snowmen with my toddler when it snows, and am continually amazed at the natural beauty so close to JC and NYC.

Jonathan Messeri,,"Thank you for the meeting on March 2.  This is my second comment and it helped crystallize my thoughts on the revitalization plan.  Both the updated review of the plan and the public comments were very helpful.  I am a member of the marina for the past 20 years and also a user of many of the other areas of the park.  While  my comments primarily concern the LSP-North I do support I support the overall DEP plan and urge that the park remain as open and natural as possible.  Given my primary use of the park is a boater. I do realize that the facilities I use are a form of development on the edge of the park that while open to the public is fee based.   I many ways the marina in addition to providing resources for recreational boating it also contributes to the openness of the park.   The walk along the docks is used everyday for walkers/runners/bikers/commuters.  It provides a real connection to the Morris Canal and going east to the river itself.  So here are my specific comments on the Phase 1B.   

1) Please retain/enhance the pathway directly between the docks and parking lot.
2) Marina parking as has been stated is critical to the recreational boating facility- without it you really can't have a functioning marina.
3) Ball Fields.  While open the land in the strip between Audry Zapp and the parking lot and access roads is open it is not really is large enought to support multiple fields along with all the support needed.  Additonal parking access,  fencing lighting etc.  However this doesn't proclude the creation of a running track and to complement the track other more compatible uses small format of the space.  

Its important to keep the area open not wall it off from the waterfront and other areas of the park.  In addition on many days during the week and certainly on weekends the congestion on Audrey Zapp is signficant.  This will get compounded by the development of the rail station.  Lastly the geese population will need to dealt with for any of the development options.  

I know it may not be apples to apples however in San Francisco the Marina Green Park area maybe a good example of how to integrate an area for recreational boating/fitness and complement the nearby restored parkland in the Presidio.    BTW they just agreed to keeping areas of the waterfront open balancing the needs of existing recreational boating and direct access to the shoreline.  An open area much like the north/eastern side of the park along the canal.

- Restore 65 autumn-flowering memorial trees in the memorial landscape
- Restore the uplighting at base of memorial walls to honor the victims’ names at night with dignity and respect. These lights remain broken and need to be restored to the original candle-light glow radiance.
- Modernize and make accessible (language) the outdated technology of the digital directories in order to locate a name on the memorial walls.

LSP is the crown jewel of New Jersey. It is a place where people from all backgrounds come together to enjoy nature, the views, and celebrate special occasions with picnics. LSP is a necessary environment for countless birds and wildlife who depend on this land. It is one of the best places to run. And, as the threats of climate change loom large, it is a necessary component to ensuring Jersey City’s resilience in this uncertain future. 

A Sports and Entertainment Complex has NO PLACE in this public and natural space. In addition to handing this priceless public land over to private interests, this proposal threatens to destroy all that we love about LSP’s natural environment. It will destroy the environment, disrupt the quiet use of this space, and make it impossible to gather in the park. In addition, it will bring countless cars to our infrastructure that is in no way equipped to handle this traffic — as well evidenced by the crippling traffic that shuts down my neighborhood, Bergen-Lafayette, every Independence Day weekend or any time there is an event in LSP. 

While this proposal is heralded as an economic incentive, it promises just the opposite: study after study confirm that sports complexes do not boost the local economy, they do very much the opposite - they harm small businesses while aggrandizing the wealthy who own them. 

PLEASE PROTECT LIBERTY STATE PARK and ensure that it remains free for PUBLIC USE and the wildlife who depend on it for generations to come.

I keep hearing references to making LSP similar to Central Park.  I lived in Manhattan for many years before moving to Jersey City.  Everyone loves Central Park because it is an oasis of green in a concrete jungle.  There are mostly green spaces with just enough amenities that do not overshadow the beauty of the park.  I have been disturbed by all of the plans to carve up LSP, especially the northern section, into multiple spaces for various activities and to add so much “active recreation”.  Keep LSP as the green jewel it already is.  Expand that green and add a few amenities.  Don’t overcrowd it with skate parks, fitness centers and the like.  It should go without saying that large scale entertainment venues have no business residing in a state park.  I can’t believe such absurd venues are even being proposed. Sports fields and other entertainment venues, with the noise, chaos, and general disturbance inherent in their presence are the purview of the city and not a state park.  They should be relegated to other parts of the city.
Even more importantly, LSP is a major nesting site and migratory stopover point birds and other wildlife such as the Monarch Butterfly.  More than 300 species use the park including several threatened and endangered species.  The noise and chaos sports fields create would present a significant and unnecessary disturbance to these species already in peril due to habitat loss along the Hudson flyway and human disturbance.

Let Jersey City take the responsibility of creating sporting and entertainment venues in areas that will not provide additional harm to our environment and wildlife.

we want to preserve the ecological features of the site so that families can bird watch, so that native species can find habitat to live, so that the valuable ecosystem is preserved.

Please continue to support and protect having a natural habitats area, which will benefit our ecology as well as this flood-prone region as part of a natural flood resiliency plan. The New Jersey DEP has committed to 60 acres of free, active recreational use. When considering that extraordinary and beneficial public use versus an ill-advised 7000 seat commercial concert venue and 5000 seat football stadium at the same location, the best choice is clear.

Where are the Olmsted and Vauxs who had the vision and foresight to embrace nature? This would not happen at Central Park.

The DEP should hold strongly to the original proposal of 30 acres of active recreation areas. This should be flexible use fields and not large stadiums and astroturf as floated by the paid task force in the signage. It should be limited to the south end.

The north end should NOT have this type of active recreation. It’s a main entrance to the park. It should provide a respite from the concrete, overdeveloped city and remain similar as it is today with open fields and unobstructed views of the river and city. The walk along the canal and marina should have more shade trees/trees planted for people and wildlife. Leave the existing parking for the marina and restaurants. Any sports fields will remain empty most of the time and be a waste of the green lawns. The north side does NOT need a sports hub. This is ludicrous. The state is going to ruin a good thing.

It's not intended to benefit regular people with modest incomes -- the people who regularly enjoy the park now. It's a scheme to line the pockets of the rich, cause tremendous traffic jams, and turn our serene waterfront parkland into an ugly, noisy, expensive place. Sure, there'd still be a walkway along the river, but instead of gazing at seabirds in their habitat anyone strolling the walkway would see a wall of yachts lining the waterfront, a reminder of who the park is really for. I don't want to see the name of our park turn into an ironic joke. Liberty should stay free.

The only plan I'll support is one that preserves the current spirit of the park -- wide open spaces, views of wildlife, and freedom from pay walls. We need a park that gives those things to people who can't afford to jet off to a mountain retreat or sail a yacht to a private island.

LAURA FOORD,,"Dear Design Task Force:
Please consider these things before making any changes to LSP:
1. It is the ONLY  place of its kind in our urban environment. The ONLY opportunity for students, lovers of art, environmental enthusiasts, and lower-income people to immerse themselves in unspoiled nature in our backyard. 
2. The impact of development of this space on the adjoining community will be catastrophic. Every time a game 'lets out' or a concert takes place, traffic through the local streets will be impossible. For reference, look at what took place on July 4, 2022...... it took us HOURS to get in and out of LSP. I didn't see any plan for dealing appropriately with the local traffic impact. And, if the people-in-charge are truthful, they will acknowledge that there IS no plan that could work here. Development will be horrific to the surrounding neighborhood. Many of the residents there are of lower-incomes, and do not have the political resources or connections to protect themselves against development which will harm them directly.
3. Once development starts, there will be no stopping it. There will be incremental changes, all in the name of supporting infrastructure. A bigger parking lot, more water pipes, support for greater needs for electricity, food courts......... it goes on and on. Another example of how the Task Force needs to look at this with some real honesty.
4. Our society needs to recognize the value of 'passive recreation'. The ability of a family to go to the park for a picnic, throw a frisbee, fly a kite, sit on a blanket looking over at the water and taking in the warm rays of the sun, taking a bike ride through the LSP trails.......... ALL of these activities have just as much intrinsic value as organized sports and outdoor concerts. In fact, the lack of alternative spaces for people to do these things makes the LSP space all the more valuable. (Value is NOT determined by the ability to generate income!)
5. A comment was made at the meeting at LSP that it appears that certain people are  trying to offload the  responsibility of Jersey City for providing youth sports and organized recreation by advocating for placement of those things in LSP. If so, this is wrong. Yes, kids need more ballparks and track, but these can be achieved by placing them all around the City where access is more  convenient for the youth than to go all the way to LSP.
6.  In fact, those who argue that the Park is being underused by City residents should consider researching how transportation may be employed to bring people to the Park at low or no cost. How about frequent  bus shuttles throughout the City, from schools and other places? This would aid in reducing auto congestion and cost to those who wish to visit the Park.
7. Think Central Park, NYC.     Without that Park, what would Manhattan be today? There is an opportunity NOW to protect LSP for future generations!
8. There are more points to be made, but they were made very succinctly by others who attended the LSP meeting. PLEASE protect this amazing space! Thank you for reading this.",laura.foord@yahoo.com
Laureen Hudson,,"Literally everything about this project is poorly thought out, and will have devastating impacts not only for the marina, but for sheer quality of life for anyone having to use any of the roads or the transit around this space, to say nothing of the damage to migratory birds' habitat.

I get that it's important to give rich people what they want, and this whole project seems to mostly be about that. But I think that Liberty State Park can do better, and give regular people their continued access to largely undeveloped open spaces. The park doesn't need ""revitalization"" -- come out here on any day, winter or summer, and watch thousands of people enjoying it exactly as it is. 

I think the most salient point, though, is that there are plenty of stadiums locally to play in; there is only one Liberty Park. Please let it continue to be what it is; a spot for uncluttered reflection, peace, connection with nature, and unparalleled skyline views.",splashing@gmail.com
Yvonne Balcer,,"The State of NJ as well as the municipality of Jersey City is densly compacted. Some parts have the same density as India. Also, new housing in urban areas does not provide open spaces such as backyards since new housing is now multi-storied. New Jersey and the municipalities in Hudson County need open space. There are times I have traveled to Liberty State Park and there is no parking, if a commercial revenue was in LSP, the little parking would be gone earlier. Keep the park free from commercialization especially, Caven Point.",yvobalcer@aol.com

Donna Ristorucci,,"I was at the October Open House and spoke at the DEP open meeting March 2. I generally like the DEP’s Phase 1B for the Northern Area and LSP Phase 2. I agree with Friends of Liberty State Park that as a state park, LSP’s primary purpose is for open space for unstructured, active and passive recreation and enjoyment of nature. Looking at the plans, I think the DEP might be trying to do a bit too much, trying to include every suggestion under the sun  ( e.g., I don’t think we need that water thing in the train shed, and perhaps we don’t need quite so many fields), but I think there is a generally good balance. I especially like the use of the shed and other areas for cultural and educational activities.
I would like to see a more comprehensive public transportation plan to the park from PATH stations and various other points and neighborhoods around the city, maybe even from other nearby cities, so people who don’t drive can get to the park. Not all non-drivers can ride a bike. Also, as has been suggested by others, more shade along walking paths. It’s hot during the summer!
I do want to add my voice to those who are ABSOLUTELY OPPOSED TO A LARGE STADIUM, AMPHITHEATER, or any other large, commercial enterprise proposed by billionaire Paul Fireman and his surrogates. Nor should our beautiful state park  be converted into a venue for national or world sports events, which I also heard suggested by a Fireman surrogate on the task force.  LSP cannot provide all of the city’s sports and recreational needs. People who are justifiably advocating for more recreation facilities and programs for their children might do better to turn their sights toward the city.
Thank you for standing firm against these proposals (so far), and keep up the good work!",donristorucci@gmail.com
ted devoe,,"I am very concerned about the removing of the parking along marina. The fire department and ambulances use the paring lot roadway when audrey zapp dr is congested during holidays, weekends and large events in the park.  Also removing this parking lot access would restrict emergency vehicle access to a large group of boats.",teddevoe@yahoo.com
Gloria Devoe,,"I have a boat at Liberty Landing Marina. Very concerned over the removal of the parking lot.  Sometimes the traffic on  Audrey Zapp Drive can get heavy and therefore cause the Police to come thru to our parking lot to get to the area they need to get to for emergency. We also need to have the parking lot for fire trucks, ambulances for emergency either on the boats or for to have accessibility to Liberty House Restaurant and Maritime Parc Restaurant or other parts of the Park when lot is quicker to get thru the Marina parking lot.

I am also very concerned about taking away the sidewalks to the Marina so that we can carry things that need to be put on our boat,  Also, many adults, kids, etc walk  and  ride their bikes along the sidewalk to get to all parts of the park.  Many people are pushing Baby Strollers, and we have people on walkers.

Alex Rozental,,"For me, it is more than just a park – it is a sanctuary of beauty, history, and joy, a place where he could escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and reconnect with what truly mattered most: family, freedom, and the boundless wonders of the world.
I couldn't help but notice the absence of commercial activity within the park. It was refreshing to be in a space untouched by the pressures of consumerism, where the focus was solely on nature, history, and family. I always appreciated the park's commitment to preserving its natural beauty and heritage, free from the intrusion of commercial interests.",ixylus@gmail.com
Alex Vasin,,"As the sun began to rise over the Manhattan skyline, Alex felt a sense of anticipation bubbling inside him. Today was the day he had been looking forward to for weeks – a trip to Liberty State Park with his family. Ever since they moved to New Jersey, Alex had heard nothing but praise for the park's beauty and charm.

As they arrived at the park, Alex's eyes widened with wonder at the sight of the Statue of Liberty standing tall against the morning sky. It was as if Lady Liberty was welcoming them with open arms, inviting them to explore the park's treasures.

Their first stop was the Liberty Science Center, where Alex's kids eagerly raced from one exhibit to another, their laughter echoing through the halls. Alex couldn't help but smile as he watched them marvel at the wonders of science, their curiosity sparking with each new discovery.

After spending the morning at the science center, they ventured outside to explore the park's expansive grounds. They walked along the waterfront promenade, soaking in the breathtaking views of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. The salty breeze danced through Alex's hair, carrying with it a sense of freedom and possibility.

As they strolled through the park, Alex's wife suggested they have a picnic by the water. They spread out a blanket and unpacked their lunch, savoring each bite as they enjoyed the tranquility of the park. For Alex, it was a moment of pure bliss – surrounded by his loved ones, with nothing but the sound of seagulls and gentle waves in the background.

After lunch, they decided to explore the park's historic landmarks, including the Central Railroad of New Jersey Terminal. Alex felt a sense of awe as he stood in the same spot where millions of immigrants had arrived in America, their hopes and dreams carried on the winds of change.

As the day drew to a close, Alex and his family reluctantly said goodbye to Liberty State Park, their hearts full of memories that would last a lifetime. For Alex, it was more than just a park – it was a sanctuary of beauty, history, and joy, a place where he could escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life and reconnect with what truly mattered most: family, freedom, and the boundless wonders of the world.",alexvasin355@gmail.com
Gary Sedoruk,,"About 4 years ago I was amazed at the plans to continue to bring the restore the balance of the Liberty State Park to its full potential as a nature preserve. Everyone knows and acknowledges that this property plays a huge role in supporting both native and migratory species. And then something changed, it appears the balance of the park already developed for public use appears to have been thrown into a rushed political gambit where the existing uses are being sacrificed to the whim of those who wish to make the park a playground. I take no issue with the proper adding and placement of facilities in the park that address other activities, I just cannot believe the lack of planning and coordination that appears to be taking place and this will forever destroy the nature of the park in general. The marina operated by Suntex is a particular concern of mine. This marina not only supports a large number of resident boaters, but it also supports sailing schools, commercial operations such as the Statue Tour Boats, jet skiing, international sailboat racing events to mention a few. Why does the State of New Jersey, not even mention its existence in its executive summary. Clearly there is no recognition of the value that will be lost when it is forced out of business. 

The Development team seems devoid of all logic when considering intensifying the use of the land adjoining Audrey Zapp Drive without plans for road improvements that will support the amount of traffic that will be generated. The State is well aware that when the bridge connecting the park to Jersey Avenue opened it created a significant increase in the local traffic patterns. The intersection of Audrey Zapp and Jersey Avenue with the convergence of pedestrian, bicycle, car and truck traffic is already a true hazard and now we want to introduce another layer of users with no thought to their overall safety. 

The State needs to put the brakes on this rush to put a completely flawed plan in place without a realistic review of the options. The park is huge, the area also currently used by the existing facilities are also significant. If given a true evaluation those spaces could be reimagined to maintain a world class marina and to provide world class recreational facilities while providing of the safe and efficient transportation of goods, services and most importantly people into and throughout the park.",gsedoruk@outlook.com
Lucinda Mercer,,"I am 100% in favor of the DEP's revitalization plan of Liberty State Park. I live in Hoboken and use Liberty State Park frequently as a get away. I am particularly excited by the natural wetlands area with over 5 miles of walking trails I saw highlighted at the public meeting on March 2. We desperately need more green space as well as area that will mitigate flooding, which this will. 

I also love the idea of rehabilitating and repurposing the CCRNJ train sheds for public use. The existing building is beautiful and historic and it is important to maintain our connection to history as well as create more space for the community to come together in a variety of settings. I would also like to see other community gathering spaces and areas devoted to arts, culture, and history. I see all of these in the DEP's plan.

Finally, I believe there should be extensive work done to ensure that the bulk of the park is kept free of cars and is safe and attractive for pedestrians and cyclists. A well-located parking lot combined with internal shuttle bus or tram transportation should be considered. And, as a cyclist, I am extremely interested in seeing cycling infrastructure included in the plans such as separated bike lanes or paths. Cars, pedestrians, and cyclists should each have their own areas.

Under no circumstances should the DEP consider putting in a large sports stadium, a commercial concert venue, etc. This is the people's park and must remain so.",lucinda.l.mercer@gmail.com

Keiko Rife,,"I support the current two phase revitalization plan for Liberty State Park, which is the product of a  hard-fought-for consensus between the NJ DEP, long-time park advocates and the people of New Jersey. It's a plan that prioritizes flood-mitigation and balances the area's need for recreational opportunities with the need for open space; open space that is difficult to come by in this the densely populated, heavily developed urban corridor. The plan being advocated by the People's Park Foundation -- stadiums, concert venues, a whopping 12 additional sports fields and accompanying parking lots -- ignores flood mitigation and, in fact will make flooding worse. It also would exacerbate an already congested traffic situation at the park entrances. The notion that New Jersey would scrap the hard-fought-for current plan for the billionaire Paul Fireman's out-of-the-blue plan strikes me as reckless and more than a little corrupt.

Michael Smith,,"The current Phase 1B design eliminates the parking areas and vehicular access to marina docks along the north side of the Northern Area, which provides needed parking and vehicular access for the hundreds of boating tenants of Liberty Landing Marina, and which provides access for emergency vehicles when needed for the marina (ie emergency vehicle access to marina docks and other essential marina facilities). The proposed sports fields will add demand for parking while removing hundreds of parking spaces, which will place immense pressure on the much reduced parking capacity that would result from the design, plus will create severe traffic congestion on Audrey Zapp Drive which already is congested when events are held in the Park.  The design for Phase 1B needs to retain the parking areas that run along the north side of this area, the adjacent walking path used extensively by park users and by users of the marina, plus retain the cherry blossom trees that run alongside the walking path.",mpsmith565@gmail.com

Jimmy Ho,,"Liberty State Park is indeed our cherished urban oasis, providing respite for both humans and wildlife. Our concerns about its future are valid, and citizens of Jersey City are passionate for preserving this natural haven.
Here are some key points to consider:
Commercialization and Privatization Battle:
There has been an ongoing battle against billionaire Paul Fireman and his surrogates who advocate for commercializing and privatizing parts of Liberty State Park.
Their proposals include interior commercial venues such as a 5,000-seat stadium and a 7,000-seat commercial concert venue.
However, the overwhelming majority of the public supports maintaining the state park as a FREE and accessible urban public space, emphasizing nature, recreation, and open space for everyone.
Paul Fireman, owner of the Liberty National Golf Club, has been at the center of this debate.
His golf course lobbied for a law encouraging new development within the park, which raised concerns about privatization and commercialization.
It’s essential to balance any development with the park’s ecological significance and public accessibility.
Caven Point, a part of Liberty State Park, serves as a crucial stopover for migratory birds along their path.
The beach area is closed to the public for a certain amount of months each year to protect these bird species.
Preserving this habitat is vital for maintaining biodiversity and supporting our feathered friends.
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has emphasized that there will be no privatization or commercialization of the park!
Their vision includes diverse nature habitats, walking paths, and FREE active recreation for all visitors.
Paul Fireman recently paused his expansion plan into Liberty State Park to allow advocates to address social justice concerns related to the park. This pause highlights the need for thoughtful consideration of any changes to this valuable public resource.

Liberty State Park’s unique blend of natural beauty, recreational opportunities, and ecological significance should be preserved for current and future generations. We need to continue to advocate for its protection and responsible management and not so the golf course can put in a few extra holes for its exclusive members 🌿🌳🦆🌼",Hzu8@hotmail.com

Colleen NcNulty,,"Please no more commercial anything in LSP. To paraphrase a woman’s thoughtful statement at the March 2 forum, if you want commercial entertainment, there’s plenty of  that just a few miles away at American Dream. We’re talking about a state park; what’s a developer doing throwing his hat in the ring anyway?
Developers have been having  a field day in Jersey City for years. Many neighborhoods are now practically unrecognizable and there are more and more high rises and fewer and fewer open spaces. Let’s protect and preserve the unique and natural beauty of LSP for everyone and for our future generations. I think that the appeal  of the park’s natural beauty is universal and it’s there for every one of all ages to enjoy in all seasons from morning until night. 
As far as changes go, I would like to see  more trees planted  and a few simple shelters built to provide some shade and cover from rain. 
The park is well used and it was delightfully crowded on my last visit. But parking and traffic jams were problematic. Also, what can be done to minimize noise and disruption of park traffic to the surrounding neighborhoods?
My thinking about active recreation is that flexibility, how often the court or field, or whatever will be used, and how much space  it uses should be considered. Are football fields really practical? Would they be used mainly only in the fall?
Now I’m contradicting myself a little here but I would like to see the inclusion of a few splash pads. It’s true they can only be used in warm weather but they wouldn’t have to take up a lot of space. Kids seem to love them and they’d be a welcomed relief from summer heat.
Lastly, when making changes to this place, please strive to protect and support and never lose sight of the park’s natural beauty.

Beverly Cavanagh,,"I think it's a good idea for Jersey City to provide a recreational sports facility, but not in a precious natural resource like LSP.  This oasis can provide other types of learning and recreational experiences found in few other places on this area. Ball parks should be built in local neighborhoods. Why not build a major sports facility in the west side of the city? It's more accessible; would help the economy there; could collaborate with NJCU with teaching and sporting events; and would leave LSP to what it was meant to be. If the city is spending so much for the Pompadour Museum, why not also for another grand scale Roosevelt Stadium? We all know the interest big business has in the Park stems from money and greed.

Diane Sterner,,"Thanks for the opportunity to comment on the plan for Liberty State Park.  My main points are:

* it is important to avoid any attempt to privatize or commercialize any sections of the park. While private interests are trying to influence elected officials to rule on their  behalf, the proposals of these private interests are based on their own economic benefit and not on the public interest.  They should be avoided at all cost.

* This means no stadiums, no expanded golf course, etc, etc.

* The DEP's plan for Liberty State Park deserves all of our support. This plan calls for a significant amount of active recreation, which is well balanced with natural areas that will not be developed. Creation of this plan stemmed from a healthy and substantial public process which should not be disregarded.

Steve Chisholm,,"We have enough athletic venues and music venues in NJ.  While I certainly support them where they currently exist, we are not in need of more facilities or traffic.  Liberty State Park was designed as a passive park and a portion of it was dedicated to those lost on 9-11.  This park may be in need of some improvements, but a major overhaul and redesign is not something that has the support of the average NJ resident and taxpayer.  There are not enough natural areas and open space in northeastern NJ, and none with the views of NYC and our dear Lady Liberty.

Ellen Rich,,"I OPPOSE PHASE 1A of the DEP plan to flood 170 acres to create wetlands and marshlands. This will not, it does not, protect the city from future flooding. It is not for flood protection, as the DEP has stated over and over again; instead, it is purely a natural restoration project.

This may have been relevant 25 years ago when this plan was developed. Since that time, sea levels have continued to rise, and we know that bringing water closer to a city that already floods is irresponsible and dangerous! Land is so valuable in our city; how and why would you take away 170 acres of it? Our kids and community are suffering from a lack of recreational opportunities and programs.

I SUPPORT and ask the DEP to create multi-use fields for sports (adult and youth), a community center, community gardens, a dedicated music space for theater and the arts, and a dedicated track and field for people to train on. This would enhance the community and provide much-needed health and social benefits for all who live here.

I OPPOSE the DEP’S plan for 50 acres of recreation because they have put it in the most inaccessible place in the park where no one without a car would be able to access it. They have prioritized the creation of swamp lands over people. They have given the community crumbs and told them to take it or leave it.

I OPPOSE how this public process has taken place! The Commissioner has dictated to the task force and the public how things will be, versus the other way around. The task force is supposed to listen to the public and come up with a plan and present that plan to the commissioner.

The commissioner is not listening to the public. He chose to hold the meeting in a room where hundreds of people were left out and then skipped over names of people who signed up to speak. I know that because many people, including myself, were excluded from speaking in person and online and our names were skipped over a 4-hour period! A dozen seniors were left in the lobby because the commissioner chose a room that did not include everyone! 

I’m disgusted by this process, and the governor should shut it down immediately and start over. There is no transparency or honest public involvement. The DEP and the commissioner should be removed immediately from this process to revitalize LSP for their disregard and irresponsible actions.",Ebrich@gmail.com

Mattias Johansson,,"Listen to the public: do not build or accept any commercial sport arenas in LSP. Do not listen to Paul Fireman's paid surrogates - they do not represent the public, only Firemans personal commercial interests..

A public park should be a place where the public can  relax and enjoy greenery, fresh air, play and active or passive recreation on their own or with friends and family; free from  commercial interruption and development.

Only include sports facilities where the public can TAKE PART IN active recreation, but not include arenas, stadiums and the like, that serves as places for watching OTHER people doing sports.

Anatolii Leskovets,,"As a Jersey City resident for 5 consecutive years now, I can't deny the importance of the Liberty State Park for the city. This is the place my family goes when we are looking for a piece and quiet, to have a walk in the alley and watch for wildlife and beautiful nature.
I am can't say how disappointed am I when I hear that LSP is about to be the host for a new stadium or a new golf course (which already being the part of LSP that is closed to public, preventing you from access some of the areas with great city views).
I do support the initiative of creating new sport objects in the park like small track field and tennis courts along side the marina, I would be interested in a good bike lane around the park, similar to what Central Park has. I would love to see more green spaces and trails and walkable space.

Phase 1 of the proposal does look right (excluding some of the public transportation like buses).
But the Phase 2 is what raises the concern about the greenery of the park and being yet another commercial object that should not be used accordingly.",advisory.true@gmail.com

IT IS A STATE PARK AND NOT A GIVEAWAY TO THE RICH FOR THEIR OWN AMUSEMENT OR MONEY-MAKING SCHEMES. Why is this the only State Park in NJ that is continually fighting for it's survival?  

Why do there need to be more buildings and amenities? Let those happen in Jersey City itself. There also do not need to be more ""opportunities"" that require more traffic and more parking.

Lee Magadini,,"I've been a resident of Hoboken, NJ since 1986. I am STRONGLY OPPOSED to the proposed development by the ignorant and greedy Fireman.  Promoting this ugly development is abhorant and will destroy the natural beauty of this park and coastline that is shared and appreciated by not only humans but is a home to birds, amphibians, and other animals as well as endemic plants.  As part of the North Atlantic Fly-way it is an important a stop-over for birds during seasonal migration.

This is an opportunity for NJ to be a leader in the preservation of the natural world for future generations to enjoy.  The Earth is overrun with greed-driven development and is being diminished daily by the kinds of profit-motive eye-sores that Fireman wants to develop.
 As Rachel Carson states in ""Silent Spring"":  ""We now stand where two roads diverge.  But unlike the roads in Robert Frost's poem, they are not equally fair.  The road we have long been traveling is deceptively easy; a smooth superhighway on which we progress with great speed, but at its end lies disaster.  The other fork-the one ""less traveled by"" - offers our last, our only chance to reach a destination that assures us the preservation of our Earth.""",Lmagadini@mac.com

David Sullivan,,"The irreplaceable natural resources of Liberty State Park should not be squandered on sports and concert arenas, especially with the false narrative that the state should make up for Jersey City's lack of commitment to its own, poorly maintained sports facilities.  There are many places suitable for such venues that would not savage the raw, natural space that could become our own Central Park.

I took offence of the ""Task Force"" members asking to take this very public discussion behind closed doors.   I commend the DEP for working to dispute their false narratives and working hard to keep the greater public involved.  I appreciate the opportunities to provide input, review options, and add my voice to this public process.

Hugh Carola,,"I FULLY support the NJDEP plan for Liberty State Park (Phase 1B: Northern Area Recreation, Arts & Culture and Liberty State Park Phase 2: Holistic Long-Term Master Plan). It perfectly combines restoring and protecting the NATURAL integrity of the park, ensuring that it remains a free and accessible park for all, and provides appropriate active recreational amenities. There should be NO commercial development whatsoever of the type proposed by the ""Peoples Park Foundation"".
In general my ""default position"" on state parks is that they should not include ANY active rec (ballfields, basketball courts, skate parks, etc.). However I recognize the unique nature and history of the LSP area and am convinced that the FAIR, OPEN and comprehensive NJDEP process has provided the perfect solution that does virtually everything RIGHT - including the RIGHT amount of recreational redevelopment. As such, the NJDEP-approved plan is the ONLY one I can support.",hughcarola@gmail.com
Elena Messina,,"There are several proposed plans that seem to prioritize athletics over accessibility and nature. Having three athletics fields in the North area and another athletics complex in the south area is overkill especially since most people will not be using athletics fields. Building multiple sports fields not only limits the space that the majority can enjoy, but also removes the much needed natural spaces that the park has. With sea level rise inevitable and more severe storms becoming the norm maximizing natural space is essential to preserve the long term viability of a park on the water. There is no need to have 3 athletic fields in the north area, when they can easily be combined into one, as in one proposal. I am also surprised a baseball field was proposed to be build next to a marina with boats. It is possible baseballs could be hit into the marina hitting boats and littering the waterway. 

I also think it is essential to preserve the integrity of the Grove of Remembrance. The grove honors those who have fallen in 9/11 and others, and it is essential to keep the grove intact to honor the legacy of those who are no longer with us. The planning of the proposed trains should accommodate the existing Grove.

The most concerning of all the proposals is the Southern athletics hub and stadium. The stadium being built on existing natural land, is a disappointing and surprising proposal.  Parks are about giving people better access to nature, which it seems like the redevelopment wants to do by implementing public transit. Destroying much needed natural land to build a stadium is the antithesis to the purpose of Liberty State Park. Building any concert venue/stadium on existing natural space is taking away something that can be enjoyed by all, all the time with something that will be enjoyed by some a few hours a week. Also, with climate change only continuing to worsen, natural areas with trees that absorb carbon and heat are worth more than any stadium.",emessina@njtreefoundation.org
Ellen Nutters,,"There is an old saying, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” So much of LSP ‘ain’t broke’. This is will be my third year as a member of Liberty Landing Marina which has given me a great amount of time to not only participate in the life of this marvelous park but to observe, as well. I have continuously been impressed with the quantity and diversity of gatherings at the park from couples strolling arm in arm, to groups of bicycles, to grandmothers pushing prams, to large families celebrating, to lone strollers counting steps. Not much organizing needs to be done to make these visitors happy. Certainly, fixing the rail station and creating a multi-use site would be beneficial. Use of the newly mown fields as potential athletic sites might be nice. Further areas with plantings would be attractive. Additional lighting at the Audrey Zapp entrance may improve safety.
 
What wouldn’t work and would be outrageous is impinging on the much used and well managed site of the marina. The marina is a stunning attraction for tourists, amblers, dog walkers and cyclists. Looking over the canal and watching the beautiful boats take off on a journey to parts unknown is a lovely way to wile away the day while walking under the cherry trees.  You can even turn and watch people playing with their pets on the adjoining field. To successfully enhance the park it must be noted that boaters have needs: sufficient easy access to close parking, ensured safety for their costly vessels. The ‘stuff’ boaters haul is manifold and constant! Balls flying wildly overhead, threaten multi-million dollar vessels! 

It would have been wise to have spent time, money and energy actively surveying to find to what is ‘needed’. 

This is our third marina, the most expensive and the best. Without the conveniences offered now, I can’t imagine returning.",Enuttersny@aol.com
Maureen Chandra,,"I'm a minority woman living in the Greenville section of Jersey City. I am writing to express my profound appreciation for Liberty State Park, a true oasis nestled amidst the hustle and bustle of Jersey City. As a resident of this vibrant city, I have come to cherish the park as a sanctuary of tranquility and natural beauty.

In the midst of Jersey City's bustling streets and towering skyscrapers, Liberty State Park stands as a testament to the importance of preserving green spaces within urban environments. Its sprawling lawns, meandering trails, and picturesque waterfront offer respite from the concrete jungle, allowing visitors to reconnect with nature without having to venture far from the city center.

One of the park's most remarkable features is its stunning views of the Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty. Whether you're taking a leisurely stroll along the waterfront promenade or enjoying a picnic with loved ones, the iconic backdrop serves as a constant reminder of the rich history and cultural significance of this area.

Moreover, Liberty State Park offers a wide range of recreational activities for people of all ages and interests. From biking and bird watching to kayaking and fishing, there is no shortage of opportunities to engage with the great outdoors. The park's expansive fields also provide ample space for sports and leisure activities, making it a popular destination for families, fitness enthusiasts, and picnickers alike.

In addition to its recreational offerings, Liberty State Park plays a vital role in preserving and protecting the region's natural habitats. Its diverse ecosystems support a wide variety of plant and animal species, making it a haven for wildlife conservation and ecological research. By safeguarding these precious resources, the park helps to promote environmental awareness and sustainability within the community.

Furthermore, Liberty State Park serves as a cultural hub, hosting a myriad of events and attractions throughout the year. From outdoor concerts and festivals to historical exhibits and educational programs, there is always something new to discover and experience within its boundaries. These events not only foster a sense of community and belonging but also contribute to the economic vitality of the surrounding area.

In conclusion, Liberty State Park is truly a gem in the heart of Jersey City, offering a peaceful retreat from the chaos of urban life. Its natural beauty, recreational opportunities, and cultural significance make it a cherished destination for residents and visitors alike. As stewards of this precious resource, it is our collective responsibility to preserve and protect it for future generations to enjoy. Please don't allow any commercial sports complexes or concert stadiums in Liberty State Park.",dv709@yahoo.com
Regina Joskow,,"My family and I have lived in Hudson County for 33 years, and last 27 of which have been in downtown Jersey City. Throughout that time, we've spent countless hours enjoying everything Liberty State Park has to offer -- open, green spaces, wildlife, magnificent views of the Hudson, a place for the kids (and the adults) to run and play and breathe, a place to meet with friends, ride bicycles, picnic, connect with the natural world, and connect with our community in myriad ways. The park probably helped save our sanity during the pandemic when our movements were restricted: the park provided us with open space during one of the most challenging times our community has ever faced. I've attended all of the presentations by the DEP and have closely examined their plans, and their vision for the park is so smart, and clearly factors in the potential ravages of climate change while creating recreation areas that will meet all of the community's needs. We must be good stewards of this beautiful land and ensure that this park stays open to all  and continues to serve the needs of the public -- both the residents of New Jersey as well as the many, many visitors from around the world who visit every year.

Faith Lau,,"Thank you for preserving the natural resources and free public access to primarily natural activities. Some active recreation, as outlined in the DEP’s plan, is fine, but it should not be expanded from the original plan. A state park should definitely not house a sports stadium or other facilities that would burden the park and neighboring communities with traffic, and stray from the objectives of a state park.

These natural resources are irreplaceable and should be protected. The State Park should not be used to compensate for neighboring Jersey City and Hudson County’s lack of planning for youth sports facilities; other land should use used for such purposes. Conversely, Hudson County’s park should not be paved over by State level greed to allow for fee-based, private, commercial venues (outside of small scale concessions along the lines of what other State Parks would have).

Morris Canal park, across the water to the north from the train terminal and adjacent to the Korean War memorial, needs to be thoughtfully handled and transparently planned.

Frank Bosco,,"I'm encouraged to read that James Mcgreevy and Governor Murphy are behind the DEP's vision for the development within Liberty State Park. What is worrisome and I'm encouraged to read that James Mcgreevy and Governor Murphy are behind the DEP's vision for the development within Liberty State Park. What is worrisome and even downright contradictory is Mr. McGreevey's comment, quoting,  ""I respectfully, but vigorously disagree with calls for large-scale development of any venues that would draw thousands of spectators and their cars into the park. The DEP plan has struck the proper balance"". 
On the face of this comment, it completely mirrors my own assessment and hopes for the future of the park. But the DEP's proposal frighteningly shows a much contrary position.
The proposal may try and reduce car traffic, which it will not. It contributes access  to a carnival level, as congestion from the: On-Demand shuttle buses: high-speed bike lanes; low-speed bike lanes; e-bikes and scooters; multi person-bikes; pedicabs, kicks in.
Liberty State Park may be an uncut gem, but why attempt to turn it into junk jewelry. Liberty State Park should be on the endangered species list of Historical parks, with careful, considerate, intelligent, perceptive initiatives to RESTORATION,  not reinterpretation, and certainly not ""large-scale development"".
Imagine if all that's proposed actually is built. Imagine the congestion, the traffic from every which way, the noise, and the effect on the precious wildlife.
Liberty State Park is NOT Coney Island, Is NOT Atlantic City, nor the plethora of carnival sites along the Jersey Shore. IT'S AN IMPORTANT HISTORICAL LANDMARK. Ball fields, and sports venues, a beach, turning the shed into some kind of restaurant-mall, does NOT honor the history and legacy of this park.
Getting to Yellowstone Park is not easy for me and my family. I need to book a flight, rent a hotel, and a car perhaps, or a shuttle. Liberty State Park can also take some effort, it's ok. Why throw the baby out with the bath water? As it is, anyone who wants to visit the park can do so. They can bring their own bike, or e-bike, walking shoes, bike, stroller, rollerblades, skateboard, etc., or whatever else they want. Why supply all these additional modes of transportation, all these unnecessary venues, unless the REAL reason is MONEY into the coffers of individuals, the City, and the State. So basically the park is being SOLD. Surely LSP could benefit from some carefully thought out plans like improving the trails, more landscaping that restores and preserves historical local plant life; a plan that preserves the quietude and natural beauty along with the history as a cultural Immigration landmark.
The concept by the DEP for the park is indeed ""Large Scale Development"" and will only INCREASE spectator congestion, to the point where there's simply nowhere in Jersey City to go and find peace and serenity, nowhere! PRESERVE AND PROTECT LSP,  IT'S HALLOWED GROUND. IT'S NOT A PLAYGROUND and CARNIVAL.

Fred Sulllivan,,"Liberty Park is a community asset for the State of New Jersey, Jersey City, the Nation, and the World because the Statue of Liberty is just off its shores. However, it is also a critical point for the ecosystem of one of the largest estuaries in the United States. The DEP plans for the restoration of wetlands and saltwater marshes are excellent plans that support their essential resources. It is a unique area for migration from birds and insects within the Eastern Flyway. One can build playgrounds and stadiums in the many places available for development in Jersey City. The Green Acres trust terms and agreement must preserve this as parkland, not another development zone supported and lobbied for by a wealthy property owner and paid advocates. All people in the city will benefit from the ecosystem restoration that would have been here and will add resilience to it and the development surrounding it. Race does not determine whether nature is vital for physical and mental health.  It will also reduce the heating by providing natural cooling to the surrounding areas. There are active recreation facilities in the area that Jersey City needs funding to restore, and a baseball and softball complex and stadium are a little bit away from being neglected and much more acceptable to the population the advocates for active recreation and stadiums want to serve. An Ice Rink at Pershing Field Park has been mostly closed for the last two seasons. It needs an overhaul to make chillers more sustainable year-round, which already has supported local teams. So this, for example, is needed more and should be located within the neighborhoods and populations.",fredjet15@gmail.com
Rebecca Dicks,,"We are so fortunate to have the large expanse of open land next to the continually developing urban area of Jersey City and beyond. Municipalities around the world are working to create places of calm as a refuge for city dwellers and a therapy to thwart depression, a  buffer for the rising temperatures in urban areas, 
and a sanctuary for wildlife. I ask myself, why would we open LSP to commercial development when we already have such a place as a retreat from city life? The DEP has been doing an admirable job of trying to balance the recreational needs of the city and maintaining the open areas so needed as a retreat. However, some of the large stadiums and concert venues that have been proposed will only detract from the desirable aspects of parkland. Therefore, I am opposed to any addition to the park which would only add more traffic from large events beginning and ending at the same time, causing  congestion, trash, and the noise from large events held at the park which will reverberate and be amplified by the surrounding water. The things which we try to escape when we come to a park. At the last meeting I was impressed that it was stated that the DEP is relaxing its view of parkland to include some areas where sport can be enjoyed.

Nicholas Lawrence,,"I'm speaking as a father of a seven year old, as a resident of Jersey City, as a social studies educator, and as a community leader in my role as president of the Washington Park Association of Hudson County. 

The plan proposed by the People’s Park Foundation to build a stadium and other commercial venues in Liberty State Park not only goes against the public opinion of nearly all local residents, it would be a regional disaster and a national embarrassment to allow. Such a project flies in the face of our shared values to protect our children, the Garden State and the democratic institutions Americans herald and seek to lead the world in supporting. What does not do this is the Department of Environmental Protection’s project, which is carefully designed to protect the harbor and Jersey City, among other cities just inland, as well as to build up the park to make it more useful, safer and accessible to New Jerseyans. 

It's no longer a debate that humans need to act and act decisively to preserve our natural resources and combat climate change. This is abundantly clear in New Jersey, where half the state has in recent memory been ravaged by major storm systems and will likely be again. Commercial elements of the PPF’s proposal flies in the face of the mutual understanding New Jerseyans of myriad political persuasions hold- that in order to maintain and preserve our great state, we need to be putting in place resiliency plans and infrastructure to protect it. This applies to the shore, to New York Harbor, to the Pine Barrens, to the Water Gap and everything in between and beyond. Projects in key ecological areas should and have been carefully designed to ensure not only increased use and appreciation for our natural resources, they will also set us on a trajectory to address our climate reality and put New Jersey in a position of leadership in this work nationally and globally. The Department of Environmental Protection’s plan can and will do this.

New Jersey is no stranger to political corruption and has a reputation for outsized party and monetary influences making decisions in spite of the will of the citizens of our state. The outsized influence of billionaires on global politics plays out in many places including right here at home, but the United States has the mechanisms to combat this and demonstrate to the world that democracy can work. What the PPF’s plan does is to serve as a demonstration in how money can make decisions over a democratic process and over the will of the people. Unfortunately it will also reinforce stereotypes of New Jersey that its people would love to leave to its past.

In an age when democracy is at risk of fading into history, our leaders should be standing up to say we will not capitulate to the interests of rich individuals at the expense of the public and the environment. They should be standing up, leading from the front and saying that the public will not sacrifice our environment, our home and the health and well-being of our children for the benefit of the billionaire class. Our leaders should finally be making it clear that they are committed to not shouldering the next generation with more economic and environmental debt. Many of our local leaders are, in fact, doing this, including Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and State Senator Raj Mukherji, who support implementing the DEP’s plan.

Beyond obvious monetary influence issues, the People’s Park Foundation’s plan will with all likelihood one day sit ironically as a set dilapidated venues behind the Statue of Liberty as a message to the world that the voice of the American people is not as strong as its richest class; that an entire community and a state government will bend a their knees to a billionaire’s will not because they actually want to, but because that billionaire openly wields political power and there is no other choice. It will send the message that those with the golden spoons in the United States make decisions over the masses of immigrants who came through New Jersey’s Golden Door and those who were here before it even existed. In an age when environmental justice is at odds with power and influence rather than supported by it, the PPF’s project will stand as a symbol of the injustices done to our children’s generation.

The decision to stay the course with the Department of Environmental Protection’s plan is a simple one and it’s the right one. The question remains as to whether those making this decision believe in New Jersey, in giving our children a future and in democracy.",nickjlawrence@gmail.com

Gloria Weiss,,"I submitted a comment on 11/16/23 that I still stand by. I have a boat docked at Liberty Landing marina all year long. Both Liberty State Park and the Liberty Landing Marina are jewels that need to compliment one another. In November 2023, I wrote about my concerns that the 3 planned recreational fields right next to the marina along with the removal of the marina tenant parking area would not only hurt Liberty Landing Marina but could also endanger the boat users as emergency vehicles wouldn't have the needed quick access to each dock entrance. Also having 3 recreational fields so close to the marina and the entrance to the Liberty State Park will cause a huge traffic jam with so many people coming to both participate in and watch the games. The entrance to the park on Audrey Zapp Drive would be better served as a passive recreational area showing the beauty of the natural park welcoming visitors. A community garden with raised vegetable beds and fruit trees run by park staff who can offer tours and classes would be another welcome sight and educational opportunity to learn about upon arrival to the park.

The park should be a source of natural beauty that invites the community to enjoy nature. There should be no commerical stadiums in Liberty State Park! Having areas for people to walk, bike, jog, picnic, garden, and play surrounded by the beauty of the natural environment should be the goal of the revitalization program. Having recreational sports fields is important to meet the needs of the community but need to be located in areas in the park that won't create traffic congestion which makes coming to the park stressful and pollutes the park's clean air. Liberty State Park does not need a large sports and entertainment complex and Liberty State Park revitalization should not hurt the marina that is so successful and adds to the park's attraction. The task force should enhance Liberty State Park and not hurt it.",weissgloria@hotmail.com
Stan Karp,,"I am a lifelong NJ resident, an avid hiker and biker, and a retired public school teacher who relies on NJ's public parks for recreation and enjoyment. I strongly support the DEP plan for Liberty State Park because it prioritizes nature and recreation and sharply limits commercial development. I am opposed to any large stadiums or more privatization of public lands. We have had enough of both in NJ.

LSP already has enough development; keep the park as natural and sustainable as possible while supporting low impact and accessible recreational use.

Thank you.",stan.karp@gmail.com
Christina Mueller,,"The redevelopment of Liberty State Park should focus on open space, nature and wildlife, and free public recreation options, with particular emphasis on the environment, climate change and flood resiliency.  It should not include large sports or performance venues that would commercialize/privatize the park, charge admission and cause the park to be over-developed.  We do not need Meadowlands-like sports complexes in Liberty State Park that charge for admission, parking, etc.  The park amenities should be free or very low-cost to accommodate the public.

In addition, close attention should be paid to the cost to operate the public recreation options that are being considered for the park.  Currently, there is much infrastructure in Liberty State Park that is deteriorated and in need of improvement.  It appears that the park currently operates with an insufficient budget for infrastructure needs, maintenance and programming, and is quite dependent on the help of volunteers.  If recreation options are added to the park that are costly to operate (community centers, swimming pools, etc.), has attention been paid to the future funding sources needed to maintain these spaces and offer programming at them?

To the extent that recreation spaces and programming are needed for the local Jersey City community, we should take a close look at efforts to advocate for these amenities to be placed in Liberty State Park (particularly amenities that are more costly to operate, such as community centers and swimming pools, as opposed to hardscape features like playgrounds, sports fields, skateparks, etc.).  Advocates for placing these amenities in Liberty State Park should shift their focus to lobbying the municipal government of Jersey City.  It is the responsibility of the City to provide recreation spaces and programming for its residents.  Many of the City recreation facilities nearby Liberty State Park are currently in disrepair - efforts should be made to hold the City accountable.  Also, there is rampant development in the City near Liberty State Park.  To the extent that more cost-intensive active recreation facilities and programming are needed, pressure should be put on the City to provide those options for its residents using land that is being developed.  New Jersey state parks are woefully underfunded and many are in general disrepair; it is not wise to shift onto NJ state parks the responsibility to build and operate recreational facilities that Jersey City should be providing for its residents.  The municipal government should be held accountable for the needs of local Jersey City residents.",chris7878@hotmail.com
Lisa Schnettler,,"Liberty State Park, in it's current state of open green spaces and paths is the most efficient and flexible use of space.

An open swathe of grass can be used to:

picnic
play frisbee
play with a soccer ball
play catch
play a pickup game of volleyball
fly a kite
etc

A basketball court can be used to:

play basketball
that's it

A baseball field can be used to:
play baseball
play softball
that's it.

And baseball fields in particular require a certain amount of organization. While a couple of people could spontaneously play with a basketball hoop, to make actual use of a baseball diamond, you need 2 organized teams.

When dedicated sports fields are not used for that specific sport they lie empty and awkward between games and during the off season.

Dedicated sports fields are of no use to people who don't play that particular sport; people with infants; elderly people. 

Dedicated sports fields serve a small minority of the population some of the time. 
Open fields serve the vast majority of the population all of the time.

Paths can be used to:
walk
run
bike
rollerskate/rollerblade
scooter
push baby carriages

Paths can be used at any time of the day or year by anyone at any age.

On any day you will see Liberty State park used by a tremendous variety - and number - of people. No space is empty. Every space is used and appreciated and NEEDED.

Jersey City is currently well served by various city and county parks as far as dedicated sports fields are concerned. In 49 years of living here, 21 years of parenting here, I have NEVER heard anyone say, ""oh, if only my soccer/baseball/football team had a field to play in"" THEY HAVE THEM ALREADY. There are plenty. The idea of using limited, valuable, waterfront property to serve a tiny number of people (and, yes, there are a relatively TINY number of people who play on sports teams compared to the full population of Jersey City, Hudson County, and outside visitors to LSP) is absurd and, frankly, misguided at best and evil at worst.",lisaschnettler@gmail.com
STEPHEN GOUGH,,"I was in attendance  at the March 2, 2024  DEP hearing at the LSP  Rail terminal.
I am a cousin of Liberty State Park Co-founder,  AUDREY ZAPP.   Cousin Audrey was 
a sweetheart and an ""environmentalist"", and definitely would NOT be in favor of the proposed plans for commercialization, or any stadium or  commercial concert venue.  She would abhor the large paved parking lots necessitated by such proposed uses, and their unavoidable large impervious drainage area.  She would be disgusted by the obfuscation being employed by the ""moneyed interest"" attempting to confuse youth athletic facilities - public ball fields and basketball courts -  with the proposed commercial stadium and concert venue, and any golf course expansion.  Furthermore, she would be heartbroken  by the ""moneyed interest's"" attempts to pit the Jersey City youth  sports community against  Sam Pesin and the Friends of Liberty State Park.  She would be very dismayed by the  degree to which the DEP Commissioner and ""Design Task Force"" apparently are being swayed by these efforts of  the ""moneyed interest"".
                    On a more personal note,  I would recommend and request that any further ""public hearings"" necessitating a ZOOM computer audience also provide an auxiliary sound / speaker system, as the acoustics of the rail terminal made it very difficult to HEAR.

Thomas Ogorzalek,,"Comments Phase 1B: Public amenities along the Audrey Zapp Drive corridor 
a.  The proposed community center would be a positive addition for LSP and the local Jersey City residents with minimal impact to traffic along Audrey Zapp Drive. 
b. Northern Athletics Hub: as presented during the recent public meeting this area requires reconsideration. It is clear that a football field, soccer field and baseball field do not fit into this area to adequately play the sports listed and require substantive parking and support amenities that are not considered in the proposal. Perhaps a single multipurpose field for this area with dedicated parking for this field and dedicated parking for the Marina residents. 
c. CRRNJ train shed: the proposed covered outdoor public community space and marketplace is an excellent addition to LSP. The question of who runs this still remains to be sure this venue is accessible to all demographics that visit the park and does not become economically out of reach for visitors.
d. Arts and cultural spaces with harbor/skyline backdrop: This proposed enhancement of the field located at the end of Audrey Zapp Drive adjacent to the existing parking area would be welcome and consistent with LSP mission. I have concerns about accessibility for the inclusion of an outdoor amphitheater that was proposed during the March meeting. In addition the location was not appropriate and is better suited for green infrastructure and ecological enhancements.
Comments Phase 2: Holistic Long-Term Master Plan
a. In general the preliminary schematic planning for the various areas of the park appear to be consistent with the mission for LSP. I am especially in favor of the enhancement of coastal wetland habitat along the freedom way waterfront areas. This should be a priority when considering how soft infrastructure can become opportunities for restoration of indigenous flora and fauna to be enjoyed by visitors and provide protection for storm events. 
b. The proposed location for a southern athletic hub seems appropriate as it will keep the majority of vehicle traffic for this destination outside of the park, but a traffic study would be necessary as proposed venues are considered.  When considering proposed recreations venues none of them should be private for profit facilities. The Park is already making an exception in their mission to develop recreational sports facilities and in doing so they need to be open and free to the public. The scale and size should be small and not present a detriment to the local flora and fauna as the mere creation of them is already destroying an existing mature ecosystem that has providing benefits to one of the densely populated areas of the state. 
c. Overall there will need to be additional iterations of the future plans of this area that include input from the public and experts to determine if the preliminary area designated for the southern recreational hub is appropriate and does not provide any long term detriment to the local ecological systems in the Park.",thomas.ogorzalek@gmail.com

Laurie Champion,,"My husband and I have a boat slipped at LLM for over 10 years. During seasonal spring, summer, fall weather the parking lot dedicated to the marina and it's residents is full and often finding a space close enough to off load provisions is impossible. Looking at the plans, the green space throughout the park has been enlarged exponentially across all areas without providing any appropriate additional parking for the dedicated sports fields, nature preserves, and trails. For the engineers and designers of this project to assume most citizens arriving via mass transit, is a pipe dream. Let's compare the Science Centers dedicated parking area, the existing 2 restaurants, ferry terminal, the marina, and the parking area behind the rail terminal. There is no way you have accounted for the overflow of park enthusiasts, including those who will attend weekly team competitions and playoffs throughout the year. Soccer with its popularity encompasses dozens of teams with 25 members or more, the same as football. Those team players will not be arriving by foot or Train, they will be arriving in car/van loads filled with family members all dumping out into the park. You have not provided any parking for all the individual needs of each of the residents of the marina, restaurant diners, large banquet halls and their guests, the ferry and its commuters and finally those who visit the park for recreation or bird watching. Yes, the design is lovely but not practical, perhaps in the middle of NYC where there are dozens of subways and buses to support such a park and its visitors. Quite frankly the sports area (Phase 1B) should be placed in the 50 acre area of phase 2A where the stadium for track and field is proposed. Seriously? a stadium for track and field vs football, soccer, and baseball fields?  Which do you believe will be of more use to park goers in a city such as Jersey City directly across from NYC? Any recreational space intended to be built adjacent to a residential area must be more critically studied and researched. Do you have any idea how difficult it is for those living on their vessels 24/7 at Liberty Landing marina have at offloading provisions, animals, guests to board their boats is especially difficult if you've now moved their parking hundreds of feet away from the dockhouse in order to obtain access. In winter the water is turned off and now residents must take their own 150' foot hoses and connect to various insulated water bibs to replenish their water holding tanks. The reason so many live aboard vessels is to remain, work and live in New Jersey. The docking slip fees have become so exorbitant it equals or exceeds property tax in many NJ townships. My husband lives on our boat because he works throughout New York Harbor, our resident home is in southern New Jersey and if he had to commute, the stress and drive would eventually take his life at 70 years of age. Please consider re-designing the Liberty State Park Revitalization program so your intended ""vision"" works for everyone including their parking of vehicles transporting them there!",ljchampion@comcast.net
Caitlin Doran,,"Friends at NJDEP,

Myself and fellow nature enthusiasts enjoy Liberty State Park for its passive recreation and natural setting. We value and prioritize places to sit and picnic in the park, enjoy and learn about its shortline i.e. at Caven Point, and experience the park from the water i.e. from the park's kayaking tours. We also have a deep appreciation for what the Friends of Liberty State Park do, which includes beautifying the park with plantings. 

New Jersey is expected to reach total build out in our lifetimes, making natural spaces our most precious resource (and not sports arenas, concert band shells, and associated parking lots). With the metropolis and built environment all around and closing in, let's keep Liberty State Park a passive, green, natural space, for the people of NJ and the surrounding areas to enjoy, and especially the people of Jersey City, who bear the brunt of all the negative effects of having little to no nature in their community.

Sally Jane Gellert,,"I am upset at the continued proposal of traffic-causing, high-ticket facilities disturbing the urban oasis that is Liberty State Park.  The DEP plan carefully balanced preservation of the flood-control capability of the less-developed center area of the park with more active recreational and community areas, and included a shuttle service that has been much needed since the Christie administration ended bus service within the park.  In a city with 38% of households without access to a car, it does not make sense for such a large park to not includes transportation options.  A medium-sized amphitheatre on the shore makes sense; the massive developments suggested by Mr. Fireman and his colleagues does not; those would change, for the worse, the character of the park.  Use the expertise of scientists and urban planners, not the greed of would-be developers, as your guide.

Please stick to the original state plan, carefully worked out to take community needs into account, and reject the proposed high-cost options that focus on profit instead of quality of life.

It is also important that the task force—the value of which I question, but what is done is done—hear from the public at every opportunity.  Members calling for closed-door hearings and walking out on public comment should be removed from the task force; they obviously have their own agenda that conflicts with the task force’s objective of serving the public (and if the task force has any other objective, it should simply be disbanded forthwith).",SJGUU@aol.com
Mario Verdibello,,"Over many years, as Vice President of International Business Development and Operations for a major environmental/engineering company, I often entertained delegations of foreign clients and engineers by taking them to Liberty State Park (LSP) for an unparalleled view of the Manhattan skyline, Statue of Liberty, etc.  Invariably the visitors were awed by the view, but what they particularly admired was the huge, open green space and the tranquility of LSP so close to a very urban setting.
And so it should be for a State Park which, by definition, ""is an area  created for the protection of its natural beauty and importance in history"" , NOT for its commercial exploitation and major entertainment venues!
Over the last twenty years, Jersey City has undergone an explosive construction growth which has left the city with major traffic congestion and other associated problems.  This explosion, unfortunately, has not included any additional green spaces, so what the city desperately needs is more open green space, not major commercial venues that would gobble up some of the precious existing green spaces while adding to the already untenable traffic congestion and pollution of all sorts.
As an engineer and nature lover, I believe that DEP has already made a major concession to the request of a small minority of urbanites who demand more ""recreational facilities"" for their youth by designating 60 acres for future recreational facilities.  This is actually a huge area, perhaps even too large in proportion to the overall size of the park, and certainly more than is found in any State Park in this and other states of the country.
It is imperative, therefore, that DEP hold firm and resist the private and political pressure exerted by special interest groups to include in their plan the construction of a large sports complex and entertainment center. 
The vast majority of the public wants LSP to remain, first and foremost, the green oasis in an urban setting that allows people to seek refuge from the urban din and enjoy nature without restrictions, undue pollution or the need to travel hundreds of miles from home. Please don't be swayed by misplaced and selfish interests!  Thank you.",mverdibello45@hotmail.com

Amy Coplan,,"Dear Sir/Madam:

I am against the development plans for the commercialization of Liberty State Park.  Liberty State Park , an open, natural space enjoyed by a multitude of people is a beautiful, NEEDED respite in the middle of our dense, urban area.  Its purpose IS being fulfilled  -  it provides a beautiful, safe, natural landscape with a million dollar view of NYC for everyone to enjoy in their own way.  It's a refuge for us - where people and nature connect - both physically and mentally.  

I, for one,  do not want our park converted into a commercialized area.  We already have places like that as there are no shortage of commercialized venues for entertainment and recreation in our State.  What we need is our PARK!  PLEASE don't turn one of the last natural landscapes in the middle of our City into a commercialized venue.

There's a reason why Central Park is one of the jewels for the people of NYC and one of top-rated tourist attractions in Manhattan.  People NEED nature, quiet and places of respite!

I'm not so naive to not understand that money talks - but if legislation passes to turn this natural jewel into a commercialized zone (as per the plan), there will be no turning back and the beauty and reprieve that this land gives us will be gone forever, not just for us, but our children and their children.

Seth Rieder,,"I’ve recently moved to the Communipaw area from Brooklyn. During the past several months I’ve been learning about the area and the history of LSP. Eventually I stumbled on the plans for restoration and active/passive uses for the park. I was thrilled to see so much planned for LSP, which while lovely, doesn’t yet live up to the grandeur and enjoyment of Prospect Park, Governor’s Island or Central Park. The current plans will put the park on a similar level, while making it unique to the region.

The more I dig into the plans the more I’ve discovered that everything isn’t necessarily a done deal. That a certain billionaire continues to try to weasel his money into the process in the hopes of building an entertainment complex on a large section of the park land. I hope the DEP can stay true to its vision and keep steadfast in its plans to make the park a place for all and an opportunity to restore nature in the densest region of our country.

In regards to the 1B and 2 phases, the plans as is are exciting and wonderful, and I particularly like the improved access around Johnston Ave, including the dog park and natural play area. Plus a roundabout to hopefully make the primary entrance for pedestrians more pleasant and safe.

My suggestions are the following:
- Continue finding ways to increase access to the park via bike/pedestrian paths from adjacent neighborhoods. 
- Calm traffic on Philips Street, the roundabout proposal is great, but cars will continue to fly down the remaining stretch along/past the science center.
- Continue to find ways to create natural woodlands, marshlands and hiking opportunities. Much of the existing park is made up of grass fields that are rarely used but for the occasional flock of geese.
- Consider a botanical garden perhaps focused around marshes, bogs, and wetlands.
- Keep vehicular access and parking within the interior of the park to a minimum. Personal vehicles create noise, pollution, and ruin the ability for people to connect with a bit of nature in one of the densest places in our country. Plus parking eats up vast swaths of land that can be used for far better purposes.

Paul Bellan-Boyer,,"There is a great vision for Liberty State Park. It is rooted in a truly accessible, open and uncongested park which preserves the most vital and the most threatened resource in New York Harbor and the NJ Hudson waterfront south of the GW Bridge. This precious resource has multiple dimensions:
- Wetlands which protect developed areas;
- Habitat for wildlife; and
- Open space so lacking in Jersey City and Hudson County.

This precious resource is Liberty State Park. It is the Liberty State Park preserved and protected by Friends of LSP,  a Park with the DEP's interior habitat's plan, a Park which provides flood resiliency and carefully limits development. This is a vision supported both by science and by strong, consistent, decades-long public action. It is NOT a park with a Sports and Entertainment Complex whose commercial features are available elsewhere in the region.

edward farnum,,"I mostly like the plan.  I had not considered the park as a place for soccer fields or basketball courts, but I'm not necesarilly opposed to it, as long as they are small, and free for everyone to use.  I *AM* absolutely opposed to closing fields and courts and charging admission - any admission - to watch.  There are two simple details required to keep the park free (in addition to remaining vigilent to special interest groups with lots of money.)

First, keep the number of spectator seats low.  I have lived in Jersey City for the past 18 years, and have raised two kids here.  I have been to many, many soccer games, swim meets and track meets.  I know how many fans show up for a kids soccer game.  It's about 3 or 4 for every player on the field.  Maybe 5 would be a stretch.  A 5000 seat arena is completely unnecessary and not at all in the public interest, unless there are 1000 kids on the soccer field, which I think there are not.  The second requirement is that there should be no fence around the fields.  As soon as there is a fence there is the temptation for someone to charge a dollar or ten or one hundred.  No doubt they would argue that they need to charge this admission to recover some of the costs of building an expensive stadium.  If the state can't afford a high end stadium, then it should not build one.  And even if it can build one, it should not be in a state park.  The park is for public use, not private profit.

To be clear, we in Jersey City and the surrounding area need more open space.  This is a wonderful opportunity.  What we do not need is more sports arenas or concert venues.

Liberty State Park is a treasured sanctuary that provides open space, clean air, and access to nature and the waterfront for anyone who enters the park. We welcome the NJDEP's improvement plans for the park, which include an additional 61 acres of active recreation and 165 acres of diverse nature habitats. There are plenty of places in Jersey City to build a stadium, racetrack, large concert venue or other commercial proposal without forever destroying the last parcels of truly open space available to the public - and to the remaining wildlife - in the region.

Susan Myers,,Please preserve Liberty State Park as a place of exercise and recreation with minimal barriers to such activities like anything that would increase traffic or fees necessary to access the park.

Mark Bloomberg,,"I am in favor of adding athletic fields, such as what the DEP has previously proposed for Liberty State Park. While LSP is a State Park for all New Jerseyans to enjoy, this will no doubt benefit Jersey City residents the most. I also believe Jersey City legislators should be spending time focusing on additional recreational facilities throughout the city and should not be leaving LSP to shoulder the burden from the lack of investment in their own city parks and schools.

I have no interest in seeing commercial enterprises such as a sports stadium or performing arts center. I don't believe they have any place in public parks.

I am in agreement with the DEPs most recent diversion plans to provide flood mitigation, recreation and space for wildlife. I do not understand why a new commission has been created to review the plans which it is my understanding were already arrived after a majority consensus of feedback.

County Commissioner William O'Dea,,"The Liberty State Park revitalization plan represents a significant opportunity to transform and enhance one of New Jersey's most cherished public spaces. As a place of natural beauty, historical significance, and cultural importance, Liberty State Park holds a special place in the hearts of residents and visitors alike. The revitalization plan aims to build upon this legacy by investing in improvements that will benefit the community for generations to come.

I have always taken pride in consistently opposing efforts aimed at the over development of or commercialization of Liberty State Park for decades. I also have faith and respect the DEP Commissioners stewardship on this issue.  

One of the key aspects of the revitalization plan is the enhancement of park infrastructure. This includes upgrades to facilities such as picnic areas, playgrounds, and restrooms, as well as improvements to pathways, lighting, and signage. By modernizing and maintaining these essential amenities, the park will become more accessible and welcoming to all who visit.

In addition to physical improvements, the revitalization plan also seeks to expand and diversify the park's programming. This includes the development of new recreational opportunities, such as hiking trails, bike paths, and water sports facilities. It also involves the creation of educational programs, cultural events, and community outreach initiatives that will engage visitors of all ages and backgrounds.

Furthermore, the revitalization plan aims to preserve and protect the park's natural resources. This includes initiatives to restore and enhance habitats for wildlife, improve water quality, and promote sustainable practices throughout the park. By prioritizing environmental stewardship, the plan ensures that Liberty State Park will remain a haven for biodiversity and a model of conservation for years to come.

Importantly, the revitalization plan is being developed with input from the community. Public engagement sessions, surveys, and consultations have been conducted to gather feedback and ideas from residents, stakeholders, and park users. This collaborative approach ensures that the revitalization plan reflects the needs and desires of the community it serves.

Overall, the Liberty State Park revitalization plan is a visionary and ambitious undertaking that has the potential to transform the park into a world-class destination. By investing in infrastructure, programming, and environmental stewardship, the plan will create new opportunities for recreation, education, and community engagement. I am confident that with careful planning, thoughtful implementation, and ongoing community involvement, the revitalization of Liberty State Park will benefit all who enjoy this treasured resource for years to come.",wodea@hcnj.us

The community does not want these establishments here! Liberty State Park is not the place for it.

The northern area does not lend itself to ball fields - particularly not baseball or football that nobody uses. Maybe a public soccer field... I think the lawn north of the access road could be turned into a big community garden where people could be given small allotments.

Frederick Miller,,"Liberty State Park is a unique resource as is and the plans to remediate the inaccessible areas are wise and deserving of support. The park provides an outstanding green space to the residents of Jersey City. Filling that space with stadiums and theaters that will host for-pay events as well as taking all the space needed for the parking those event spaces require will damage the Jersey City community greatly.

On any nice day, the park is full of people enjoying themselves. They are not generating revenue for wealthy investors from Brookline MA, like Mr. Fireman they are enjoying a public park.

The traffic around the park continues to get worse especially as Bayonne adds housing at a huge pace and residents seek to avoid the tolls on the turnpike. Bringing in thousands of cars from wherever for events  will only make the lives of local residents, like myself, more difficult.

Finally, the efforts to commercialize the park carry a huge stench of corruption: of: local people being paid to foster animosity and tension between religions and races; and of politicians locally and in Trenton being paid off to keep the issue of the commercial development of the park alive.

Paul Soltis,,"While this form refers to Phase 1B and Phase 2, I wish to reiterate enthusiastic support for natural resource and historic landscape restoration as suggested for Phase 1A for climate resilience and biodiversity benefiting Jersey City's overburdened communities according to New Jersey environmental justice law.

For Phase 1B and Phase 2 I encourage continued commitment to resource-based preservation, interpretation and recreation. Please consider management plan for any new-build recreational facilities that prioritizes union public workers. Emphasize resource-based historical interpretation and preservation of rail heritage for diverse and inclusive social history at Train Shed. Instead of indoor swimming pool, consider resource-based outdoors swimming area, in an impoundment or safe area of Hudson River, or internally in a lake or pond. 

Integrate transport links within park to outgoing public transport including Jersey City Light Rail and bus lines serving and reaching Jersey City's overburdened communities. Combine public transport with historical interpretation of rail historic resources.

Include green infrastructure especially for any development bordering the waterfront to prevent stormwater runoff and protect environmental quality for surrounding overburdened communities.

For Phase 2 and long-term planning, consider integration of recreational facilities within Jersey City neighborhoods for better regular and daily access with attention to brownfields DEP has identified for development. This approach makes the recreational facilities available in a more regular and meaningful way than any location outside the neighborhood, and provides a fuller and more robust natural and historic resource experience for residents in the state park.

Link Liberty State Park to the proposed Essex-Hudson Greenway through Jersey City. Dedicate the greenway as Prosperity State Park, referring both to the role of the historic resource of the Old Boonton Line and New Jersey's rail heritage in New Jersey's economic, industrial and community development and social history, and the new state park's role as the State of New Jersey's tangible commitment to equity in the development and expansion of State Parks, Forests & Historic Sites. Together Liberty & Prosperity State Parks will recall New Jersey's motto, adopted at Indian King Tavern State Historic Site in 1777, imbuing the motto with new meaning according to environmental justice and equity for the 250th anniversary of New Jersey's first Constitution in 2026. As the original Liberty State Park was New Jersey's gift to the nation for the 200th birthday of the United States, the new Liberty & Prosperity State Parks will serve as New Jersey's gift to the nation for the 250th birthday of the United States. Revolution NJ, New Jersey's official observance of the 250th anniversaries of the American Revolution in New Jersey, runs according to law from 2025 - 2033, corresponding with the decade necessary for full achievement of the Revitalization of Liberty State Park and development of Prosperity State Park - this program can serve as Revolution NJ's signature legacy project, engaging audiences statewide across the commemorative period. A public art installation reimagining the Great Seal depicting Liberty and Prosperity may serve as a meaningful nexus at a link connecting Liberty & Prosperity State Parks.

Critics of resource-based restoration at Liberty State Park suggest the history and nature are meaningless or irrelevant to the diverse backgrounds and needs of Jersey City. For a counterexample, I suggest the model of Philadelphia's Bartram's Gardens, a resource-based historical and natural park providing meaningful and inclusive access to history, nature and recreation for a diverse and overburdened community in a similar urban setting: https://www.bartramsgarden.org/",caroleancaesarean@gmail.com
Blythe Davis,,"Thank you for the opportunity to submit public comments on phases 1B and 2 of the LSP revitalization program. I appreciate the Design Task Force’s effort to balance land and wildlife conservation with public recreation uses, and as a Jersey City resident who visits LSP almost daily, am overall very happy with the proposed plans. My personal hopes for the park are as follows:

- Up front, like many other commenters, I am opposed to the inclusion of any stadiums, complex, or other private ventures on LSP. LSP is one of very few free natural havens in Jersey City for people and wildlife alike. Preserving the natural area is the top priority for me, and I appreciate DEP’s continued rejection of proposals to construct golf courses, stadiums, and other features that will not serve the majority of the local community or protect this important ecosystem.

- I hope that viable habitat for migratory waterfowl and other wildlife will be expanded and not infringed upon by development of the athletics hub or other structures - I am excited about the climate and flood resilience plans for the current restoration of the interior, and would love to see that area filled with wildlife habitat and perhaps walking trails.

- Construction for a community center in addition to the planned athletics hub as well as recreation fields somewhat concerns me, as the athletics hub in particular will take up a large footprint in the interior of the park since it will require a new building as well as a parking lot. Since the northern part of the park will already have active recreation, and the park will already have a community center and the shed, I am personally opposed to an additional athletics hub in the southern part of the park. Perhaps the new building construction could be limited to the community center. Jersey City is extremely short on green space, with far less tree cover than many other major cities, and preserving already limited green space is extremely important to me.

- I hope that new development will involve green infrastructure, minimal paved surfaces, and native plants to as great of an extent as possible. I would like to see minimal artificial turf and concrete used in all the new features.

- I love the improved and safer bike and pedestrian access to the park from the outside. I bike, walk, or run there almost every day and would enjoy taking a more tree-lined route further from cars.",abdavis839@gmail.com

James Pustorino,,"We want a park that is a green space and haven for both people and wildlife. The last thing this area needs is to prioritize developers and sports, resulting in more asphalt, more pavement ,more artificial structures, and more impervious surfaces.

We  ask that you consider not installing artificial fields for their environmental toxicity and their  flammability.  The county parks have installed many of them and as they are flammable they need to locked and gated when not used by organized teams, thereby excluding the public from informal and unstructured use.

We would also urge you to prioritize climate change in every aspect of this plan. Any new parking areas should include pervious paving, tree islands and rain gardens. Both heat and flooding need to be addressed and we should not simply have large asphalt wastelands. (If you have not already, please consider contacting Dr. Chris Obropta , Extension Specialist in Water Resources with Rutgers Cooperative extension.)

The city and county parks in this area are overrun with artificial fields and asphalt courts. Bayonne almost exclusively considers recreation to the detriment of everything else in redoing  its city parks. Entire parks have been stripped of trees and greenspace to be replaced by asphalt courts and rubber surfaces in Bayonne. Large areas of trees have been destroyed for fields in Jersey City parks. 

The state should not also have to sacrifice acres and acres and acres of land because Jersey City has neglected to fund their schools and facilities. This is a direct result of decades of tax abatements and exemptions (primarily school taxes) for wealthy developers. The state has subsidized Jersey City schools while the likes of Goldman Sachs are exempted from their fair share of taxes by the city. Now the developers want more subsidies and Jersey City once again expects the state to provide what they refuse to fund for their school children.

When a billionaire plutocrat dictates what legislators do we no  longer have a democracy

Developers often make plans/designs for public land that they don't own and to which they  have no right. They then  engage politicians to force the public to respond to or compromise with the plan as if it is a baseline or is legitimate in order to jointly steal public land and money. We are told  to ""meet them halfway"" or are given ""permission"" to have meaningless ""input"" after the fact.

These developers’ plans for stadiums and large venues in a state park are simply gross and obscene and should not even get a hearing much less be considered. This is not their land. 

You have multiple people on this task force paid to promote one man's agenda for our public land.

It is an insult to the people of this state that, after derailing the protection act, one billionaire has dictated much of the makeup of this task force.This plan is not only an attack on our environment, the process an attack on our democracy.

Some of our legislators have been so influenced by his donations as to go so far as to promote easily disprovable developer lies about wetlands and flooding and are pushing instead for a cement covered park.

No to developer trash stadiums and venues. No to developer exploitation of our state park.
No to a cement and asphalt covered park. No to despoiling nature for cash. 
Finally, and most importantly, no to the obliteration of green space in the face of catastrophic and life destroying climate change.

Marie Curtis,,"I was thrilled to see the plans that DEP proposed for Liberty State Park. Restoring natural features, like wetlands, to preserve the park and help fight sea level rise and associated flooding. The walkways and trails for residents to explore the outdoors are all so very [positive! Your second phase with active resreation will fill any needs the local area may have for fields of play. This is all very positive. Maintaining craven's point as a wild bird sanctuary is perfect.

What I object to is the idea of commercial activities and events taking place in the People's Park. Such events require venues and huge parking lots -- all of which interfere with the natural beauty and ecosystems of the park itself. The people of Jersey City and the state as a whole deserve a free, open, relaxing environment to refresh the spirit as we view the Statue of Liberty and all she stands for. The park should be for the ""tired, poor huddled masses"" that Emma Lazarus cited in her dedication poem.

Bethany Wall,,"Privatizing public space within an urban region as densely populated as Jersey City for the purposes of creating large sports and entertainment venues is short-sighted and - simply stated - just plain wrong.  Today's Jersey City ranks woefully low in green space among top U.S. cities -- with the per capita allocation of green space dropping even further every year with rapid (seemingly unabated) growth of new residential skyscrapers.  

Liberty State Park is a precious and ecologically valuable open space that serves the entire region and its people -- even those who never step foot in it benefit by breathing air freer of particulates.  It also serves the non-human members with whom we share the land, and visitors (like birds) who migrate through it, feeding, nesting, pollinating.  Paving over large portions of this hard-fought public land that results from decades of patient ecological restoration -- and the sweat of generations of community members -- will permanently diminish the health and well being of this region's systems and people. All local inhabitants will suffer from not only the obliteration of services provided by these hard-fought ecosystems; all will be awash in new levels of pollution and health-compromising particulates generated by fossil fuel traffic drawn to proposed venue events.  

 A funny thing happens when people come together to create positive change in their communities:  the very thing community members have fought for -- usually poo-pooed by public officials and members of the business community at the front end, dismissed as ""pie in the sky"" notions put forth by dreamer types who don't understand how the world works -- become places of monetary value that are now coveted by the very entities and people that initially dismissed it.  The hard-fought green space that is today's Liberty State Park has become a critical member of the Jersey City and Jersey State community, and should be allowed to continue playing its important role intact in an ever-commercializing, ever-developing region that should be actively embedding MORE resilience measures to mitigate environmental threats, not eliminating those that already exist.

Susan Nolan,,"I feel strongly that Liberty State Park should not have anything commercial other than minor concessions (e.g., food trucks, bicycle rentals). It absolutely should not have major arenas that require large parking lots. I am disgusted with Paul Fireman's continued efforts to impose his ideas on LSP, and I am disappointed that the park is not yet protected. He and the people he funds (in government and nonprofits) do not listen to the public, and are not deciding in our best interests. The current plan allows for both passive and active recreation (e.g., ball fields, basketball courts, tennis courts) that is acceptable to residents of Jersey City and people from around the state who visit. Once we build arenas or similar large commercial venues, we cannot go back. Please save this beautiful park that provides the best opportunity for many people to spend time in nature. Thank you.",susan.nolan@gmail.com

Adding the running track is a great idea, especially if the track is an official, 400m, 8-lane running track.

These alleged ""upgrades"" are an insult to the intelligence of anyone who has the ability to think for themselves. We already have skate parks in Berry Lane Park, which is easy to access and close-by. We have plenty of ball fields in Jersey City - most of them under-used.

David Edward,,"I believe too much focus is being placed on athletics facilities and/or 'active recreation' in both Phase 1B and Phase 2. 

Both phases contemplate the addition of very large athletics facilities into LSP, I find myself strongly opposed. It's not that I'm against athletics or physical activities; rather, my concern lies in how such developments fundamentally alter the essence and purpose of Liberty State Park. By any definition I can find Parks, in their ideal form, are embodiments of nature within our urban landscapes, serving as sanctuaries where the community can engage with the natural environment. Introducing athletics facilities – with their concrete structures and manicured fields – represents a significant perversion of this natural essence. This isn't just about losing a few trees or a patch of grass; it's about a fundamental shift away from what parks are meant to be: untouched, natural spaces that offer a respite from the human-made world.

Despite progress we have made in recent years regarding accessibility there are still some voices and arguably these phases that risk that progress. More than just spaces for leisure, parks are intended to be open, accessible areas that do not prescribe how one should enjoy them. They're about offering a piece of nature for everyone to experience in their own way. Athletics facilities, by their very nature, dictate specific uses of these spaces, limiting their accessibility and enjoyment to a particular set of activities. This exclusivity goes against the inclusive ethos that parks in general and LSP especially are built upon.

The environmental impact of Phase 1B in particular, which removes a large portion of beautiful green grass and trees, further deviates from the core purpose of parks, which is to preserve and celebrate the natural environment, not alter it for recreational conformity.

Financially, the allocation of public funds towards the development and maintenance of sports facilities raises questions about priorities and opportunity costs. Every dollar spent on these facilities is a dollar not spent on conserving natural areas, supporting biodiversity, or enhancing the park's beauty and accessibility for all users. 

In essence, transforming a significant - over 70% of the land in question in Phases 1B and Phase 2 from what I can see - portion of Liberty State Park into sports facilities undermines the very concept of what a park should be: a natural haven, free from the demands and dictates of structured physical activities. Such developments risk turning LSP away from its primary purpose: to offer a slice of nature and tranquility in our otherwise urbanized lives.

I can respect the desire of sports enthusiasts for the type of major athletics facility buildout contemplated in Phase 1B and Phase 2, however it's important to remember that these loud voices don't necessarily reflect the majority's wishes. Parks are meant to be natural retreats for everyone, not just sports enthusiasts. By prioritizing sports infrastructure, we risk sidelining the core purpose of LSP: providing a space for all to enjoy nature and find peace away from urban life. I strongly believe we should resist transforming such large parts of LSP into athletic zones, ensuring LSP remains accessible and a natural sanctuary for the entire community. Please reconsider these Phases and drastically curtail the athletics facilities that are contemplated within.",starguru2@gmail.com

Marni Fylling-Ellison,,"Dear DEP.
I have a background in biology and zoology and was a 20-year-plus resident of Hoboken. That whole region of NJ was WAY more urban than anyplace I'd ever lived before, and the Hudson River was a welcomed respite. One weekend I got to go to Caven Point, at Liberty State Park, and was amazed at the natural beauty and all the wildlife that was there, right in the middle of this super urban area. Given its uniqueness, I wasn't surprised to learn about the many native species of birds that use Caven Point as a nesting ground, and was pleased to hear that they were protected during the most vulnerable time in their life cycle. And they are able to flourish because of the improving water and air quality that have allowed many other plant and animal species to thrive in this special place. 

Liberty State Park is an important free park for all of its human residents, as well, providing outdoor areas for so many who don't have yards or safe places to play outside, bicycle, fly kites, picnic, etc. Things we all need for our emotional and physical health. I applaud the Revitalization Plan and its efforts to make the park more accessible to the general public, as well as to improve resiliency through floodwater mitigation and other climate change-related allowances. 

At the same time, I'm mortified by the desire by some to add a sports arena/events venue that would cover valuable land with huge structures, greatly increase the number of cars coming into the park, and make paid activities be a large part of the park's offerings. Even more horrified that Caven Point is of interest to any kind of development. Once structures and development have occurred in a natural area, it's a long road to restore any of the nature that existed, if it's even possible. 

Liberty State Park is a priceless resource to the people and wildlife in the area (and beyond! Visitors come from all over the world!). The Revitalization Plan will enhance so much about it. Please continue to focus on keeping the park free for all, as well as retaining the natural beauty and those elements that are such an important part of the local ecosystem, more important now than ever. Many school groups come to the park to learn about nature and our planet, how to experience wonder, and be good stewards. Let's be a model for others to follow!

Thanks so much for your time.

Stone Coggins,,"As a resident of Jersey City I have been, and continue to be, extremely supportive of the DEP’s current revitalization plans for Liberty State Park. I, like most of the public, am completely opposed to any privatization of the largest public green space in our area. Our state parks should not be put up for sale to billionaires, their cronies, and their disinformation campaigns. Any politician amplifying Fireman’s rhetoric should be utterly ashamed of themselves, and I applaud Shawn LaTourette for continuing to label the “People’s Park Foundation” as the disingenuous cash grab that it is.

If Paul Fireman is truly concerned about a lack of recreation space in LSP, may I propose an alternate idea: the state should use eminent domain to reacquire his useless, ecologically destructive, $450k-a-year golf course and transform it into an expansion of LSP for the entire public to enjoy.",stonecoggins@yahoo.com

Nancy Castronovo,,"I want to see Liberty State Park preserved as open space with natural areas and no stadium or concert venues; there are plenty of stadiums & concert venues in NJ.  The Paul Fireman funded Task Force members present a conflict of interest and are merely more corrupt & fraudulent ""Pay to Play"" efforts by our Governor & legislators to fund their political campaigns.  

The American Dream in the Meadowlands started back in 2002 as ""revitializing"" the Continental/Brendan Byrne/Izod Arena which took 20 yrs. & several developers & now has missed, just last month, the 4th payment on its $387 million debt. 

Before any further decisions are made, I want to see the 2022 IRS required Form 990 for the Fireman funded ""Peoples Park Foundation"",
tax ID 86-2900300, that was filed during 2023.  The initial 2021 Form 990 is on the IRS website, as required, and reports 1 employee,
Bob Hurley, who worked 40 hrs./wk. from 3/7/21 to 12/31/21 and was paid $100,000. However, on page 10, under ""Expenses"", $103,846 is reported as ""Other Salaries & Wages"" so apparently there were more than 1 employee. The public needs to see 2022's and 2023's (latter due for filing by 5/15/24) as well as the 2021 audited financial statements.  

The DEP's website had a ""Summary Report..."" in 2021 that recommended a Transportation Study be done; the public needs to see such
study as Transportation was discussed and reported as a significant issue before any decisions be made about revitalizing Liberty
State Park.  That topic, per the March 2, 2024 LSP Public Meeting at the Terminal, is still being discussed.

Finally, there should be NO private meetings of the DEP Task Force given the information above regarding obvious conflicts of interest in
a private individual and politicians attempting to misappropriate a valuable NJ asset belonging to NJ citizens.

LSP provides a place for us to breathe as well as a space that offers refuge away from the smog and chaos that is the rest of Jersey City.

Remember the pandemic? Remember when all we wanted was a place to go with space, that was open and where felt safe to breathe? That place for many JC residents was LSP.

What about the wildlife? Do you not get joy from seeing and hearing the birds? Would you rather stare at concrete as opposed to flowers and trees? Do you want people to leave Jersey City in search of having those things close by? Making it a less desirable place to leave? Meaning property values will plummet? 
Do you care about the long term future of Jersey City or just your current bank balance? 

I urge you NOT to build a stadium nor to expand a golf course or anything of the sort that will ruin our sanctuary in LSP- just for a few people’s personal profit.

Elise Grebe,,"I write you today to voice my opposition the Sports and Entertainment Complex plan proposed by Paul Firestone. This plan, which includes 2 commercial venues (a 5000-seat football stadium and 7000-seat concert hall), is the antithesis of what a state park should be. Liberty State Park, as well as the other state parks, is intended largely for conversation and passive outdoor recreation. State parks serve everyone, offering open space for leisurely activities. They are especially critical for dense, urban areas. They are not meant to include commercial endeavors, especially ones that would generate street-clogging and polluting traffic.

Liberty State Park is a treasure. We live in Hoboken and regularly bike through the park, enjoying its vistas and open space. Year-round we see the park being used. To have money-making businesses situated within the park will permanently alter the mission of the park and the serenity and beauty of it.

Nathan Leigh,,"I object to the plan to convert Liberty State Park from a public green space accessible to all into an overly developed for-profit athletic and performance venue. The proposed development plan would limit access, remove further natural resources from a community already deprived of green space, and convert one of the region's most beloved parks into little more than a playground for the wealthy. The proposed athletic center plan amounts to nothing more than a theft of a public good to be placed in the hands of wealthy developers and goes against the entire point of having public green spaces. There are no shortage of former industrial sites in the area that could be developed into athletic and cultural centers. Leave the parks alone.",soundbulletin@gmail.com
Jim McGreevey,,"As resident of Jersey City, I frequently visit Liberty State Park to enjoy the views and connect with nature, as I walk the waterfront promenade or along the interior nature trails. For me, like the four million other people from around New Jersey and the world that visit annually, Liberty State Park singularly is a natural, urban oasis.  

Yet, with little improvement over the last decades and with some 40 percent of the park contaminated and closed off, DEP Commissioner LaTourette correctly asserts that Liberty State Park is an “uncut gem.”  Having studied the DEP plans for the restoration of the interior area and for the provision of new public active recreation, arts, and cultural amenities in the northern section of the park, as well as the long-term holistic plan, I respectfully, but vigorously disagree with calls for large scale development of any venues that would draw thousands of spectators and their cars into the park.  The DEP plan has struck the proper balance.

Thankfully, citizens and community stakeholders urged the creation of and sustained Liberty State Park over 50 years ago. Ever since, they have fought to protect it from brazen development schemes.  When I was Governor, these individuals and organizations alerted me to the need to terminate the Liberty State Park Development Corporation over 20 years ago.  I am pleased to see the Murphy Administration listening to the community and making reasonable accommodations to address the community’s needs and desires.  

I am particularly supportive of the DEP’s plans for the Interior in Phase 1A, with 165 acres of spectacular nature restoration that includes trails being paid for with monies from Nature Resource Damages litigation that was initiated while I was Governor.   Not only will nature make a dramatic recovery in the interior area with habitat restoration, but it will give Jersey City residents, and in particular our youth, the opportunity to enjoy the natural environment, which some might otherwise never have the opportunity to experience.  

Although not typical of a State Park, I strongly support the 60 acres of active recreation.  The fields along Audrey Zapp Lane are an excellent beginning to expand recreational opportunities, and a true needs assessment should be conducted before finalizing plans for the 50 acres of recreation planned for the south section of the park. I would ask the DEP to attempt to accommodate the needs of the marina and long-term operators of the dining and event facilities on the area.    

Jersey City should complement and enhance the planned recreation for Liberty State Park with similar additions around the City and renovation of nearby Caven Point Athletic Facility.   The City and DEP should work in tandem to some degree as the plans for the southern section of the park are developed.   The Commissioner has performed an excellent service in presenting proposals for public input, and the DEP should continue to do so, as additional area of the park are developed. 
 
Lastly, I agree that the Caven Point Peninsula is sacrosanct and must remain pristine in perpetuity.",jemcgreevey@hotmail.com

Phanessa Perez,,"I strongly advocate to keep LSP as a park for the people. We do not need a commercial venue or stadium. We need green spaces for families and communities to gather. We need areas that can be enjoyed freely, not venues reserved for a fee. There are already major traffic issues in our area that disrupt the lives of our residents, the people who have created the vibrant community we have today. 

We have an opportunity to develop responsibly, to be a shining example of how to preserve our ecological spaces for future generations. We have enough concrete in our cities and states, what we need are sustainable developments that provide a unique respite from the over trafficked commercial areas.  

Please consider yours and our legacies when deciding how you will disrupt the natural areas that remain. They are diminishing, and green spaces are our most valuable resource now.",phanessarhea@gmail.com

Lorraine Saulino,,"I have been a resident of Jersey City for almost 25 years.  I have seen the city grow and the population increase tremendously.  What we don’t need in Liberty State Park is a stadium or other large venues.  Liberty State Park needs to be preserved as mostly open space, for the people of Jersey City and the state of New Jersey to come and experience nature, to get exercise by walking the boardwalk across from the Manhattan Skyline, by riding bicycles or flying kites, by some active recreation and picnicing.

I make several trips a year to Governor’s Island.  Why?  Because it is beautiful.  It has history, it has art events, it has a few places to grab something to eat and to enjoy the water and the views.  Kids go there to learn to garden, to create, to get exercise in nature.  I go to escape the traffic and the noise of the city.  Let’s do a similar thing to preserve the beauty and naturalness of LSP.

To make something all New Jersey citizens can be proud of, and that Jersey City residents can truly enjoy, whatever their age or income.",Lorrainesaulino@gmail.com
Sara Genovese,,I don't want phase 1b or phase2.  I think it would destroy the land and tranquility of the park something that this area needs. There is no place like the park near NYC that offer children and adults a place to really see nature and relax in it. These plans would destroy not only the nature but also nearby residents (including those from NYC) the ability to reset. The plans would not only disrupt the nature it preserves today but it would disrupt the people who go to revive themselves in that nature.,sara.genovese11@gmail.com
Mark Sun,,"I support the DEP's current program to revitalize Liberty State Park and moreover, I strongly oppose any and all proposals to commercialize any part of the Park in order to build for-profit facilities whether it be sports arenas, music venues, or otherwise.  
The park is a vital piece of the local natural landscape, a rare sanctuary for wildlife, as well as a precious place for residents of Jersey City to experience nature in their back-yard.  It should be improved carefully and in a way that maintains its identity as such.  
The local population has already overwhelmingly made its voice heard in support of a natural and public Liberty State Park; let's use that support to make New Jersey more beautiful and accessible for all its residents.",mark.g.sun@gmail.com
Andrew Nam,,"I like the overall design plans and strongly support development for public open access for recreation, sports, and culture rather than private entertainment commercialization. 

With the goal of becoming as much of an icon as Central and Prospect parks, I do think it’s important to do two things:
1) increase accessibility into and around the park without driving - LSP is at a disadvantage because geographically it’s only accessible from the west vs all 4 directions for Central and Prospect
2) add public infrastructure that will draw traffic to the interior of the park, both on weekdays and weekends - maybe an extension of the science center, another museum, a zoo, or a botanic garden (similar to Central and Prospect parks). I am concerned the proposed public community space and marketplace by itself will only be a weekend / pop up venue, and won’t draw enough traffic / utilization to catalyze improved community culture and infrastructure. Alternatively, better developing the west side of the park might also be a good solution since that’s the most accessible area.

Both the northern (empty sky memorial, railhouse) and southern sections (flag plaza and south lawn walkway) are very nice but too far to access without driving. Also, Caven Point is the most special area and should be preserved for public access (I support improving accessibility to walkway entrance).

I believe the goal for LSP should be to provide the most nature, sports, culture, and arts engagement to the highest number of people while remaining publicly accessible. e.g. Maximize non-paying visitors from the community and surrounding area.

john steadwell,,"I'm opposed to Paul Fireman's plans for our Park.  The idea of turning over public lands for private profit is wrong headed and short sighted.  I grew up in a place that had lots more space, farm country being slowly turned into suburban sprawl.  Once the cycle starts it doesn't end:  The land can never be wild again.  local governments are continually talked into believing that each new mall built is what we need.  It will solve our money problems.  And every five or ten years we seem to need a new mall, bigger and better than the last.  The stores go out of businees or move to the new mall and the old become ghost towns.  The only people who seem to profit in the long run are the builders.  The town's budgets are still in the red.  
Building stadiums sounds like a good idea but the builders are the only ones making the money. And they will be doing it by destroying the land that the people of New Jersey paid to clean up and allow to return to a natural state. Once paved with stadiums and huge parking lots and destroying the park and surrounding neighborhoods  with the necessary transportation infrastructure, the land will never return to a natural state.  And it will be the people of New Jersey who have paid for Fireman's and his partner's profit.  Public cost, private profit.",jd.steady51@gmail.com

With over 30 years of history in our state and at one point we had over 30 track and  4 active tracks in Hudson county alone, now we are down to three. this sport holds significant value for our youth's health and mental wellbeing. Requiring only a bicycle and minimal safety gear like helmets, arm & leg pads, and gloves, BMX offers an individual-based athletic outlet. By embracing this idea, we could potentially host national and international competitions, even aiming for Olympic recognition.

Carly Berwick,,"I am a 20-year resident of Jersey City and a frequent walker and runner in Liberty State Park. Liberty State Park is both an oasis for humans in the most densely populated part of the country and a key natural area that helps absorb runoff and other water in increasingly volatile coastal weather. More hard surfaces in the form of parking or stadiums would be detrimental to people who live nearby in Jersey City and Hudson County in two ways: it would deprive us of green space in this urban refuge and would encourage water to pool and move upward toward where we live. I support well-considered recreation that has been proposed by the DEP, including additional habitat restoration and flood mitigation, but not radical departures from current uses that would destroy both the state park as a state park, a place where nature and humans can share space. 

I live 2 miles away from the park and run there frequently. It is fully accessible to residents through bike, foot, bus, and lightrail. Parking spaces are also never full unless there is an outside entity hosting an event. We have had children's birthdays there with plenty of parking; there's no need for more parking lots. While a track or soccer field would be developments that would neither reduce soft surfaces nor intrude on the recreational nature of the park, a concert or sports stadium would change the fabric entirely, impacting all of Jersey City with additional traffic. The park is currently multi-use, with tourists coming to take the ferry via the light rail, 5ks hosted by local groups on spring weekends, bird watchers, boaters in the south end of the park, families grilling on many existing BBQ stands, and of course runners, walkers, and cyclists from dawn to after dusk. These users would all be negatively impacted by more commercial venues that rely on hard surfaces and draw people worried most about where to park, rather than how to move.",cberwick@gmail.com

Outdoor space and GOOD sports facilities are a rarity in the city and with the population growing, those places are getting more and more crowded. We need these carefully crafted and selected recreational facilities and also the wetlands and embedded hiking trails for our youth and basically everyone in this city.

Lisa LoBue,,Liberty State Park is not that big. There is NO way the property and the roads within it and to it can absorb a concert venue and sports stadium. The train terminal building and the sheds leading up to have been a HUGE eyesore for decades.

That should be the first and only priority in improving the park.,lalobue@optimum.net
Jessica Zimmer,,"In all the public comments, I haven’t heard anyone ask for stadiums or concert venues.  I heard support for the amphitheater and public fields only.  That is what the public wants. 

So why squish all the free public venues into the less accessible northern end?  There is not enough infrastructure and space to support everything that the public wants and all the board’s good ideas. 

Why squeeze that all into a tiny space to make room for commercial interests like the stadium and concert venue that THE PUBLIC doesn’t want??

Angelo Cap,,"It's selfish and shameful that a billionaire wants to commercialize a longstanding public park. Phase 1B will be incredibly effective at breathing life into an otherwise underutilized portion of the park. Having that public recreation is a good use of land that is walkable, not too deep into the park, near parking, and near public transit. It makes perfect sense to be located where it is and it provides valuable amenities for the community. Additionally, the restoration of the train shed to be preserved and also utilized for festivities or markets will make LSP a destination. Phase 2 recreation hub will give even more public amenities to the city in a location that is more accessible to those accessing the park from the southwestern portion of the city. You don't realize how big LSP is until you're inside of it, so having these amenity areas will be valuable.
I do hope that with each phase, trees and greenery are planted near the amenities for shade and to dampen the acoustics a bit from the activities. Mindfulness to acoustics is important to me as someone who visits the park often to relax and disconnect from the busy, loud urban environment. Additional greenery in the park (near Freedom way and some of the large swathes of open land near the water [Crescent Field, the Green Ring]) would be appreciated and help visitors stay cool in the warmer months (+ the grass dies here so quick without any shade).

Sean A. Gallagher,,"In 2023 Jersey City ranked 95th out of 97 US cities in access to green space. Across the Hudson River, New York City with a much more dense urban fabric ranked 7th out of 97 US cities. Jersey City has no valid excuse to be ranked almost last in the nation.

So it’s unthinkable today with this knowledge that our city and state officials have allowed false propaganda to circulate and scare our public into thinking Liberty State Park’s existing natural urban forest and wetland is not currently protecting us from climate change and improving the city’s heat island effect, air quality, and stormwater sequestration. There is no actual scenario where bulldozing this 40 year old mature ecosystem to build a for-profit stadium improves the health of the our communities. It is not in the best interest of our city and prioritizes the benefit of a select few.  

It is no coincidence that New York City builds their stadiums in New Jersey. They want their city public to be healthier and neighborhoods to be more pleasant. Building stadiums for the rich pollutes neighborhoods and burdens our infrastructure and should never be prioritized over green infrastructure for the community. 

I have kids in sports and fight for field access. But the grass lawn areas that exist today are underutilized and not as powerful as green infrastructure as the forest and wetland ecosystems. As originally planned these lawns can be turned into fields our all our young children to enjoy and improve their sport. There is zero need to change the only natural landscape our city has into a stadium for the rich. 

It is a very sad reality that Jersey City is considering moving in a direction to make its urban fabric more carbon intensive and car centric for stadium access when the rest of the world is attracting people to relocate to their cities by expanding open green space.

Scott Gurian,,"If you're looking to revitalize the northern area of the park, I'd love it if you could consider adding some improvements to the 9/11 memorial. That's definitely a highlight of park, and whenever a friend is visiting from out of town, that's one of the highlights that I show them when I'm giving them a tour of North Jersey. But I feel like the memorial could be a lot better than it is!

First of all, I remember when the memorial first opened, there were lights at the base that lit up the victims' names at nighttime. It looked really beautiful and was a fitting tribute, but these lights now appear to be broken and need to be repaired! Also, I remember seeing a bunch of trees that were planted when the memorial first opened, but when I visited recently, it looked like most of them had died, which is really sad. I'm not sure what happened, but it would be great if you could replant them and restore things to the way they originally were.

Finally, the memorial just lists the people who died in the attacks, but there's no mention of NJ's first responders that aided in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, nor is there any sign or anything explaining NJ's relationship to the attacks or how they impacted Jersey City of the State of NJ, which seems like a huge oversight.

•	Integrate a tribute to recognize NJ’s 9/11 responders, recovery workers, and survivors and recognize NJ’s 9/11 continued sacrifice with dignity and respect. (This tribute would be integrated into an area of reflection in the northern portion of the site that was an area proposed in the memorial’s original design yet was not built).
•	Restore 65 autumn-flowering memorial trees in the memorial landscape
•	Restore the uplighting at base of memorial walls to honor the victims’ names at night with dignity and respect. These lights remain broken and need to be restored to the original candle-light glow radiance.
•	Modernize and make accessible (language) the outdated technology of the digital directories in order to locate a name on the memorial walls.
•	Include an educational component explaining the meaning of 9/11 from New Jersey’s perspective

To whom it may concern, 

My name is Bruce Franco. I am a Bayonne resident, born and raised in Jersey City and a retiree from the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority. I am proud of the work I did at the JCMUA to protect our local waterways. 

Like many visitors to the park, I am an avid fisherman and fish these waters from both land and on my boat for over 50 years. I have major concerns regarding our environment and the proposed remediation that I would like to share with you that I didn’t have the opportunity to do so despite being in attendance last Saturday. 

Protecting the waterways and ecosystem: 

This plan calls for the flooding of the interior of the park after remediation. However, this area is low-lying and prone to flooding. How do we ensure that the chromium cleanup is adequate?

Failure to ensure complete contaminate removal in combination with storm surges would impact the ecosystem and disrupt the migration paths of all the fish here such as Stripe bass, Porgy, American eel, Winter founder, Summer fluke, Blackfish, Oyster Crushers, and believe it or not, Spanish Mackerel. 

Capping as a pertains to future contamination of water from erosion:

Are there any erosion reports, studies or monitoring plans to ensure that capping and then flooding won’t affect the New York New Jersey waterways, wildlife and people's health. While climate is forever changing and continuously impacting our area, producing storms and surges, we have never seen before, are there any projected erosion reports for the next 5, 10, 20 years from now? Without conclusive proof, the DEP maybe creating a wetland environment that is a contaminated timebomb which will endanger wildlife, plant species, fish and people. 

Essentially your plan, if I understand it correctly, is opening a water entrance from the Hudson Bay into LSP. Is there any discussion with the state of New York about these full remediation plans specifically on how flooding over partially remediated capped land turned into wetlands might cause toxic fill to affect the combined New York New Jersey waterways?

Why do we need to lose the land at all:

This is contaminated land and historic fill that we do not have access to. We are not capping and building up on this land? Are there any reports or findings that show we cannot cap and build up? I just would like an honest answer to this question. Is it a cheaper alternative to flood the area rather than build it up? If so, is it possible to seek private investment to offset some of the expenses? 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I really hope someone can answer my questions and consider the potential impact to our environment.

Christopher Franco,,"Subject: People's Park Plan is Best for Our Kids!

Dear NJDEP task force,

My name is Christopher Franco, and I'm a resident of Bayonne. As someone who was born and raised here and makes a modest middle-class income, I know how important good parks were for my brothers and I growing up and now my niece. Sadly, under this proposed plan, recreation is more like an afterthought, if at all. 

I have followed the plans to revitalize LSP and NJDEP plan just doesn't cut it for me. Sure, cleaning up the park is important, but that's just the first step. We need a park with things for our kids to do – places to play basketball, run around, and maybe even learn to swim or kayak! The People's Park plan includes all that and more, with a community center, sports fields, and even a pool.

It's not just the recreation plans themselves but rather the location and ensuring everyone can easily access them through the park. This is also why I was really excited to see the People's Park proposal take this into account.

Right now, too many kids in Jersey City and Bayonne, especially in our neighborhoods, have to play on crowded streets or rundown courts. The People's Park plan would give them a safe and healthy place to be active, which is so important for their development. It would also be a great place for families to spend time together, without having to travel far or spend a lot of money.

I know some folks might be worried about the cost, but I believe this investment will pay off in the long run. Healthy kids become healthy adults, and a vibrant park can bring our community together.

The People's Park plan is the clear choice for middle-class families. I really hope you consider some of their inclusionary ideas for recreation and entertainment. Please, let's give my niece and others the chance to play and grow in a park they deserve.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Peter Franco,,"Subject: Disappointed in Limited Public Participation at Liberty State Park Meeting

Dear NJDEP Commissioners,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the public participation opportunities at the Liberty State Park meeting held last Saturday. For an issue of this magnitude, I was shocked to see such a small room chosen which left more than 100 people outside. I felt the police were rude and did not allow people in the room even after seats became available. While I appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about the park's future, it was disheartening to see that not everyone who attended was able to directly voice their opinions during the meeting. 

A public forum like this is crucial for residents to engage in open dialogue and share their thoughts on a project that will significantly impact our community. Especially with media attention present, limiting public participation restricts the ability for residents to directly express their views to both the decision-makers and the broader public.

Public comments delivered directly at the meeting hold a certain weight that cannot be replicated through individual emails.  The ability to voice concerns and suggestions in front of the decision-makers and alongside other residents fosters a more transparent and accountable process.

I urge the NJDEP to reconsider its approach to public participation in future meetings. A more inclusive format, allowing for extended comment periods or designated Q&A sessions, would ensure that all voices are heard and considered.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Peter Franco

F. Elizabeth Bodman,,"I am most strongly opposed to any use of the land in Liberty State Park which decreases free access for the public.  Any private use that reduces the open space in the park while profiting a private company is exactly what this land should NOT be used for.  Additionally, with the concern of flooding in the area only increasing, any use that reduces the ability of that land to absorb/mitigate water flow is foolish and short sited. Any such proposal clearly runs in opposition to the desires of the immediate residents of the area as well as NJ residents farther afield who count on this free, open space for leisure activities.",ejbodman@gmail.com

Anita Perala,,"I am writing to express my support for the DEP's plans for the revitalization of Liberty State Park. As a frequent park user and Jersey City resident, I hope the plans will continue to prioritize flood mitigation in order to protect our environment, wildlife, and the adjacent Jersey City communities. Frankly, I was disgusted to learn about the brazen misinformation spread by Mr. Hurley and others regarding wetlands in the park proposals.

I am strongly opposed to privatization of of the park and to proposals for large-scale stadiums or other commercial venues such as those backed by Mr. Fireman and his group, who seem to want to turn a public space into a private profit center.

Regarding the specific proposals for Phase 1B as presented in the image gallery, I have a few comments. I think I said this in previous feedback, but the scenic train depicted in the ""transportation"" and ""circulation"" images seems gimmicky and impractical compared to a (hopefully electric) park shuttle bus. If a park shuttle bus is included, I hope that it will include a stop at the LSP light rail station to facilitate entry into the park and encourage more people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation.

Regarding the lawn to the east of Liberty Science Center, in the Phase 1B concept image, it is labeled as a ""science lawn,"" while in the Commissioner's announcement video, it is labeled as ""playground or dog park proposed."" That space is currently used as an informal dog run by Jersey City residents, being somewhat enclosed and easy to reach on foot from both the Communipaw neighborhood and downtown coming over the Jersey Avenue bridge. I hope the plans find a way to incorporate a spacious dog run in that general area so that dog owners still have a place to bring their dogs to play safely.

In general, I think the Holistic Long-Term Master Plan does an admirable job of addressing the community's need for multiple kinds of active recreation while still providing space for people to relax and simply enjoy the views and waterfront. I hope the task force will not forget the importance of the coastal wetland habitat and fostering an environment that welcomes both local and migratory wildlife. I frequently walk and run in LSP,  and although I haven't gotten there early enough to see the seals, I have seen many birds including herons, ducks, and hawks.

Aidan OReilly,,"So let's see what's happened here. Environmentalists moved the project that became Liberty State Park from a man made disaster to a park that can not only be enjoyed by the people of our nation, but has also contributed to environmental protection of the entire area. That work is not yet completed as witnessed by much of the area being closed due to one form of poisoning or another. Politicians are less concerned with remediating the problems than they are with generating cash flow for developers and political campaigns. Let's, for a minute, give the politicians the benefit of the doubt and say that their intentions are to improve the area, just for a minute now. The type of ""improvements"" they are pushing for are for a small segment of the population, as usual. Perhaps they have too much time on their hands to think that many people have the same amount of time and money as they do so that they can run down to play a round any time of day. Liberty State Park should not be used to appease developers and contributors to political campaigns. Ti should be cleaned up to make it safe and opened to the people of this nation.

I definitely DO NOT want ""multi-purpose athletic fields"" in the Northern recreational areas and still only care for a modest bandshell for the park and not a roaring concert venue.  The park needs better public transportation to get to and not projects that will congest LSP with motorized vehicles that take up ample parking space for the same experience they can get going to MetLife.  Any and all parking for LSP should be solely for folks enjoying the natural and communal aspects of the park and not commercial franchise you can get literally anywhere else.  I'm also in opposition to the Phase 2A Southern Athletics hub.  It would be much better suited for conservation educational facilities and community gardens.

This would have the added benefit that it would connect better to the proposed active recreation near the harbor.

I recognize the need to additional sports facilities but I think the size and scale needs to be carefully considered. It absolutely does not need facilities with large scale seating and a stadium. I would think indoor and outdoor, multi-use surfaces would be the most important thing. 

I am lucky enough to live close to the park so I don't need to drive to visit but I think you need to do everything you can to encourage public transport, cycling and walking. I live on jersey Avenue and the area cannot handle more car traffic. Please think carefully about how you can discourage car use, could you establish park and ride systems with satellite lots outside of the park. Another down side of cars is the amount of space you would need for parking that could be left for open fields and open space. Please incentivize public transport.

After reviewing the current plans and the intentions of some of the future plans, I have to say that this notion of ""overbuilding"" is a real shame.

There are plenty of other places in Jersey City to revitalize for that purpose.  Keeping the open space should be the primary objective.  

I also am completely against taking the parking away near the marina.  Yes the marina people need some parking, but more importantly, we need parking at the Park if there are going to be more visitors.  ""Electronic means"" of transportation for people from a far away parking lot is ridiculous.  It will never accomodate people with large coolers for picnics and I am sure it won't run 24/7 for the needs of the marina.  You want to share the marina parking with the public, fine.

Since public comment is open about what we’d like to see in our parks, I like to advocate for keeping our park mainly intact in a non-damaging way. What is proposed in Phases 1A, 1B and 2 are fantastic. I believe in utilizing the land that is there to add on simple amenities like playgrounds, amphitheaters and small recreational areas is fantastic. There is so much benefit for the local community as well as the area at large.

Their latest proposed plan is to build a large-scale concert venue and sports arena. As someone who works at a mid-size concert venue (over 3,000+ capacity) in NYC, working with large promoters like Live Nation, Bowery Presents and AEG, I know that this would be a foolish mistake. There is data that supports that the music industry is still suffering post-COVID. The radius clause between Newark’s Prudential Center, the MetLife Stadium, and many NYC venues would cause a lot of conflict and competition and just cause further divestment in the market. Ultimately, there is very little profit to be made and would just be reckless construction on this land.

As for the sports arena, again, there is an issue with the proximity to the MetLife Stadium, Red Bull Arena, Prudential Center and more. What teams would we even get to come here?  
Beyond that, both ideas do not consider infrastructure. Our traffic and public transit systems are already taxed. As a state, we are not prepared for the chaos that will be the World Cup at MetLife. Most of the park requires people to either walk, drive or take the light rail (which has its own issues). While the current plan that I support would increase activity in the park, it accounts for making access improvements but would also not match the caliber of a 3K or 5K+ event.

What is also great about the current plan with it's three phases is that many of these improvements don't destroy the park. Construction will occur, but ultimately, very little and utilize the open space provided to create something for the COMMUNITY. Developers do not care about the community. Jersey City struggles enough with development and issues of gentrification. This park is a FREE communal space and what is proposed in this program would make this a more active, beloved space for the community. 

I’d like to thank you for taking the time and consideration and I will continue to support and advocate for the gem known as LSP.

Katie Benjamin,,"As a community member of downtown Jersey City for 15+ years, I support the existing DEP plan for Phase 1B. All plans for Liberty State Park need to balance athletic fields with open space that is beneficial to resident use. The existing plan provides a variety of sports fields for use, and gives open space for flood control and use for running and walking.

I support athletic fields and facilities in Phase 2 of the plan, particularly along Morris Pesin Road where traffic can appropriately be routed without overwhelming local roads.

I also support eminent domain of the local golf course and nearby storage and commercial facilities, so that we can expand the park for increased resident use.",KBenjamin@gmail.com

Cody Zimmer,,"I am concerned about losing the parking access in front of the docks at the marina. Some of my favorite memories as a child were walking outside of docks and admiring all of the beautiful boats. It would be a shame to see the best marina on the New Jersey side of the lower Hudson fall into disuse because of lack of access.

That might sound dramatic, but easy vehicle access is essential for a marina. We have to bring in sails, haul out garbage, and bring large and heavy equipment to the boats. I don't mind sharing the space in front of the docks and I like that the park is getting some attention and upgrades, but I would hate to see an already existing use of the park get hamstrung so badly, to the point where many people who already use the docks wouldn't be able to use it any more. Leaving the half of the parking spots that are closest to the water is the minimum we would need for the marina.

The proposed alternative uses for the lawn that includes the basketball courts and tennis courts seems like a great solution and better use of the space that would also keep the marina use intact. That would have the benefit of easy trash removal for the marina and the people using the courts. It would also keep easy access for emergency vehicles for medical and fire emergencies at the docks or the courts. Furthermore, it would keep access for disabled people to the marina docks. I know there are currently many people who would have a very difficult or impossible time getting to their boat without such close access through the parking lot being right in front of the docks. It would also keep the larger fields from feeling like they were just jammed into the first available space that would barely contain them.

As for physical quality of the lawn itself for grass ball fields it would be a poor choice for the following reasons. There is significant wind, most commonly coming from the south, because there is nothing stopping the wind from coming in off the mouth of the Hudson. As I type this we are experien in 45 mph gusts with constant wind speeds of 30mph and strong winds are a very common occurrence during all seasons in this location. There is also the concern that soccerballs and footballs would easily go into the canal or hit a boat, and let's not forget that there is commonly an unpleasant smell coming from the canal as well, particularly in the days following a storm that has overwhelmed Jersey City's combined sewer/drainage system.

The fields are also used by many geese, who would leave a lot of goose droppings on any grass field that was constructed there or any turf field that had grass nearby. The ground is also frequently muddy and would need significant upkeep to keep in a usable condition. There are also frequently deer in the lawn, particularly since the clearing from Stage 1 took place. It would not be at all impressive to visitors during the world cup to see how messy any large ball fields located in that spot would be. 

Liberty Landing Marina is the best and largest marina in the area, and it is really the only option for middle class boat owners in this area. It is one of the only marinas on the New Jersey side of the Hudson that doesn't require constant and destructive dredging to keep it viable. It would be a shame to see the last, widely inclusive marina in the area fall into disuse because of hasty planning that removes necessary parking. Please consider these long-term effects and the unsuitableness of this location for grass ball fields when moving forward with the modifications to the Stage 1b planning. I would love to be continue being a part of this wonderful community and to see the marina continue to flourish and add to the vibrancy of Liberty State Park.",zimmerlcc@gmail.com

Paul Furfari,,"I fully agree with the current, proposed DEP plan for Liberty State Park that balances athletic facilities in the Phase1B Northern Area Recreation with an interior of the park that does NOT include commercial enterprises primarily sports stadiums or concert venues.

New Jersey, and particularly Jersey City youth need more green space and athletic fields, and the proposed track/football field, soccer field and baseball field in Phase 1B plan provide the proper amount of fields and provide the rest of the community with access to walking and running trails. Liberty State Park needs balance in its recreation and the development of new fields will increase access without overwhelming the park, or converting it entirely into a series of sports fields that will only be used by limited people. Open space supports flexible use for more state residents and provides the necessary balance to the current 1B plan. 

As a state resident, I am vehemently opposed to giving the park away for commercialization - most prominently stadiums and concert venues that do not support the community and lead to increased traffic. I support improvements to the park in the Phase 2B Holistic Long-Term Master Plan, including building sports facilities along the external facing and Morris Pesin Drive. There is tremendous opportunity to build that facility with access to the highway, which supports state resident use without the burden of increased traffic inside the park. 

I fully support DEP and The State of New Jersey eminent domaining the nearby golf course and storage facilities at the south of the park for increased public use and expansion of the park, which will be a better use of nearby land and increase space for more public use.",paul.furfari@gmail.com

Anthony Izzo,,"Jersey City residents crave more green space. They desire an escape from the urban environment, a place for recreation, relaxation, and connection with nature.

Instead of prioritizing additional buildings and venues, the focus should be on revitalizing green areas that cater to the community's needs. This could include playgrounds, dog parks, running and biking trails, fishing spots, and spaces for local businesses to come together.

Preserving and protecting the city's natural beauty is crucial.  Large-scale development projects should prioritize areas outside of Jersey City to ensure a balance between economic growth and green space preservation.

Anthony Susco,,"Hello, 

My name is Dancing Tony and I Run Fun in Jersey City. As much as I enjoy hosting shows in Jersey City and love live entertainment, the proposals by The People's Park with multiple venues and other commercial enterprises are not what Liberty State Park should be used for. Liberty State Park revitalization plans are for the good of the public, while The People's Park Foundation is all about privatization without concern for any impact on the ecosystem of the park, and the park's main purpose is to serve the public good for recreation and enjoyment of the natural beauty of the park. State parks are to serve the community for free and should not be developed for commercial interests. 

I am asking that the board stay with the plans submitted by the DEP and not let the park be corrupted by the false narrative of The People's Park and the controlled influence of Paul Fireman's personal and commercial goals.

Emilie Krueger,,"The plans to add a stadium at Liberty State Park is terrible. The removal of trees along the marina as well as the change to parking access for the people that pay fees to use the marina are also ridiculous. Keeping the green spaces and areas for wetlands is vital to the park.

John Cunningham,,"To privatize LSP would be a mistake for Jersey City and New Jersey. I support efforts to clean up and improve the park so long as 100% of it remains public, un-ticketed and efforts are made to reduce the risk of flooding.",porters.fissure-0d@icloud.com
Tom Paciorkowski,,"The facilities that are built in Liberty State Park should give people a reason to travel miles to come to the park. It makes no sense to duplicate basic park facilities found at all parks across the city. Why would a kid get on a bus and travel many miles to Liberty State Park just to play basketball when he or she can walk a few blocks to a local park near their home? What makes Liberty State Park so spectacular is the things you can't do everywhere else. For example, in the summer, many families travel to Liberty State Park for grilling and picnics because you can't do that at other parks in Jersey City. I dare you to try and find an empty parking spot in Lot 7 when the weather is above 60 degrees. Where else can you go kayaking in Jersey City? And while I can ride my bike in circles at Lincoln Park, I can ride for miles in Liberty State Park without ever trans-versing the same pathway and without worrying about being hit by a car in a city street bike lane. The focus should be on keeping Liberty State Park unique and special.

Second, large sports fields such as baseball fields, football fields, soccer fields, etc. should be available for general public use without permits when organized sporting events are not being played. It would be a travesty to fence off large portions of Liberty State Park for football, baseball, and soccer fields and have those fields closed to the general public. Whenever I'm in Lincoln Park, all those fields are fenced off and locked, and nobody is using them. Why?

Third, there should be a cost/benefit analysis for every proposal. The benefit should focus on the number of people the proposal will serve. For example, it doesn't make sense to spend millions to built something that only 100 people will use. The cost/benefit analysis should focus on the cost per person. And the cost should include not only initial construction, but the cost to maintain.

Fourth, please don't put down artificial turf. I can't help but think of that song that goes, ""they paved paradise and put up a parking lot."" It would be a desecration to tear up the park's large grass fields and pave them over with artificial turf.

Finally, please don't allow any stadiums or concert venues to be built in Liberty State Park. That's a no-brainer!",kayak@blueham.com
Irena Rothaug,,"The first and most important thing when it comes to Liberty State Park is to be mindful of preserving it as an open space that is free and available to the public, and for environmental purposes. As downtown Jersey City is a flood plain, the park provides a vital buffer and sink for rain water and high tides. It provides vital green open spaces for a burgeoning and ever-growing city increasingly hemmed in by high-rise buildings. It is also a vital stopping place and nesting area for wildlife, and a spacious place where the city-bound residents can directly experience the beauty of the natural world they would otherwise be cut off from..

The ideal, then, is to maintain spaces where rainwater and floodwater can be absorbed. Any nonpermeable surfaces like parking lots, skate parks, playgrounds, or paved ball courts should be minimized or designed to minimize the impact of runoff and flooding. There should not be a football stadium, concert venue, or golf course on this vital public land-- it would not only cause additional flooding and destruction of the park, but also cut off free access to the park by the public. Any facilities would need to be carefully designed with plenteous and well-serviced garbage and recycling bins, as the estuary and harbor would end up further polluted by plastic bottles, escaped balls, and other refuse from attendees.

A farmer's market in the train sheds is unfortunately doomed to failure, since it would be located far from anyone's actual living space. Visiting and transporting groceries back to the surrounding city would require a car, which many residents don't have. Craft markets or occasional events such as the art festival would have a better chance of success, but don't require such a large space. A better use of the space would be a landscaped park or the community gardens mentioned in the plan-- that would also open up the area as a breathable space to sink rainwater.

Any facilities created in the park need to be in response to actual demand. Will these facilities actually get used if they are built? Will people use a track-and-field venue that's so far away from schools and other training facilities? Will skateboarders come to a skate park they have to take a bus to reach? These ideas simply aren't practical. These facilities make much more sense embedded in a community, not located far away from those who would use them. They should not be built in the park.

Due to environmental contamination the interior of the park has been fenced off for a long time, which has given local wildlife a place to thrive. This has also created a vital and irreplaceable natural wilderness, a green space filled with the trees, marsh grasses, and vital features so many city residents long to experience. Recreating the place as a walking area with trails and information has the potential to create a treasure for Jersey City and the state of New Jersey akin to the beauty of Central Park in New York.

At all stages, the Friends of Liberty State Park organization should be involved and have a voice in the planning and preservation of the park. These are people who have protected this vital green space and thought long and hard about how it can best be preserved for the future and accessed by the community.",i.rothaug@gmail.com

Julie MacArthur,,"As a member of this community, I love having Liberty State Park in my backyard. With so much new development (high rises, parking structures, etc.) we are seeing a loss of community for corporate gain. However, the Revitalization Plan for LSP looks to be a way to regain some of what we've lost. While I would prefer to see these developments on a smaller scale scattered throughout the various neighborhoods of the City, communal amenities are what we all need and hopefully this revitalization will provide. For example, Hamilton Park has the only two tennis courts  to serve the entirety of downtown Jersey City - this simply does not adequately serve our City's residents and I hope you keep that in mind as this revitalization progresses. 

Overall, I appreciate that Phase 1B utilizes an area of the park that is closest to the residential part of the City that is currently being underutilized for parking. However, my greatest concern is limiting public access to these facilities (and the park overall) to prioritize profits over residents. We deserve open space without cost - this is our home and public access to spaces like this keep communities healthy. If this revitalization moves forward it should only be with FREE ACTIVE RECREATION. 

I'd also like to state there should be NO COMMERCIAL CONCERT VENUE brought into LSP - This is a community area that will only see the negative effects of this, including increased traffic, noise/vibration issues, limiting access to their own local resources.",macarthur.julie1@gmail.com

We should never have allowed the private exclusive golf course.  But once the land is taken, as we have seen, it is gone forever.

Please be careful.  Ask simply who ultimately benefits from any change.  Watch out for clever private entities as they will mask their intent, mask how they compensate those making the decisions.  Gone are the old days of out-right money changing hands; now bribes are done with real estate, boats or RVs, and other means.

First of all thank you for the work you are doing and your effort to make these meetings open to all.  I live in Central NJ but have visited LSP many times and really enjoy the waterfront walk and the Caven Point Beach section when it is open to the public.  I want to echo most of the comments made by the Public.  It's an insult that a number of Task Force members, including Bob Hurley, decided to leave before the public comments.  And I agree with the public speakers that anyone receiving money to be on the task force should be either forced to resign or have the source of the money they receive be made available to the public.

LSP is a State Park.  I think the efforts being made to provide active recreation makes since in the 60 acres identified for this purpose.  I am less enthusiastic about using the grounds adjacent to the marina for this purpose.  Making the park more accessible to the local residents using a combination of walking and biking paths makes sense.  Adding a trolley/shuttle from the existing Light Rail stations makes sense (electrified please).  What should never be added to a public state park are the items being pushed by the Fireman team.  No large sports or music arenas.  No commercial facilities closed to the general public.

And please, make it clear as soon as possible what are the plans for the Caven Point Beach area in Phase 2.  In my mind the area is already a wonderful spot for nature and people who seek out this resource.  I don't think it needs much else.  I understand why it's closed part of the year for bird nesting.  That's fine.  They deserve a place in the park as well.

Ruby Jones,,"Leave LSP alone. It's for the people! The public! We enjoy it immensely just as it is. The great outdoors where we can enjoy walking, riding our bike, picnicking, children playing or just to unwind as we watch the sunset, etc.,etc. Nothing needs to be built on it. Leave it. 
It was messed up years ago when part of it was sold to some boat/ship business on the Johnston Ave side.  It became a graveyard for boat parts.  All that beautiful land where they once held outdoors concerts, a bring your own chair or blanket thing. That beautiful area was for the people too and they messed it up by allowing privatization of that land. All that beautiful green grass became mud with rusty boat/ship parts sitting on top of it.

Lauren Squillante,,"I am concerned with the inherent bias of the Liberty State Park Design Task Force when it comes to the discussion of active recreation, arts, and culture for the interior of the park. Two of the members of the task force, Elnardo Webster, Jr. and Bob Hurley, are on the payroll of Mr. Paul Fireman, who has been attempting to turn Liberty State Park into his own sports development complex for decades. In fact, in the report of the March 2023 meeting, section 5, subsection g, it says, ""During the course of the 2021-2022 LSP-D Task Force discussions, some task force members independently pursued an evaluation of parkwide opportunities for indoor and outdoor recreational development and other features. While this evaluation was conducted outside the auspices of the LSP-D Task Force, the members who privately sponsored the evaluation shared the resulting concepts with the LSP-D Task force members and presented concepts at LSP-D Task force meetings and elsewhere."" Why are members of the task force ""independently pursuing"" evaluations of any kind without the consent of the majority of the task force or the DEP? It's unsurprising that the concepts that were shared with the task force following the ""independent evaluation"" were ""a community center swimming natatorium, four (4) full size basketball courts, two (2) 2,000 seat NHL size hockey rinks, an indoor track, health center, concessions and/or restaurants, and community space; an enhanced waterfront area with kayak launch, community gardens and greenhouses, extensive walkways to explore the park, 7,000 seat open concert and event venue, 5,000 seat open, lighted football/soccer/multi-use complex with fields and stands for spectators, Olympic level open space 400 m 8 lane track and field facility, and a three (3) season open community activity center for use for farmer’s markets, craft fairs and for flex space."" 

I'm not opposed to basketball courts, a community pool, community gardens, walkways, or multipurpose sports fields with stands for spectators. However, why would Olympic size or NHL size stadiums and facilities be necessary in a community park? Is New Jersey planning on hosting the Olympics in Liberty State Park? That's not what the park is for! The park is for public use by the people of the community and for visitors from across the state and nation. Commercial sports and concert venues have no place in a public park. The noise, the traffic, and the exclusivity those venues would produce would be a major detriment to ""the people's park."" It would make the area off limits to those without the connections or economic resources to access the facilities and would certainly mean the end of a ""Liberty State for all.""

I strongly support the DEP's original plan with the inclusion of multipurpose sports fields and playgrounds in the Northern Recreation area. I have stated before that I am not a fan of turning the historic railroad terminal into a glorified art modern art exhibit. I would much prefer if the area was to be conserved and preserved as a historical site and included educational, historical interpretative exhibits. However, as long as the train shed and terminal remain free an dopen to the public, what is done there won't be at odds with the free and public nature of a state park. This is in constrast to the possibility of commercial sports and entertainment development in the park. Again, that is not what a state park is for! 

I commend the DEP for their efforts to preserve the park's environmental integrity and truly hope they will stick strongly to their original plans for free, public active recreation space for the community and extensive rehabilitated green space in the park's interior for the wider community of flora and fauna, which also deserve use of the park along with the people.

Rosana Pedra Nobre,,"As a passionate advocate for environmental stewardship and community well-being, I believe this initiative holds immense promise for our beloved urban oasis that Liberty State Park is. The enhanced ecosystem restoration plan is particularly exciting and critical for the region. By reintroducing tidal marshes, wetlands, meadows, and urban forests, we would not only create breathtaking panoramic hilltops and sweeping harbor/skyline views but also build resilience to flooding and climate change. The flood resiliency design aligns perfectly with the state's commitment to safeguarding New Jerseyans, in this case Liberty State Park, against the increasing threats posed by extreme weather events. The addition of saltmarsh and the enhancement of upland maritime habitats will not only protect against flooding but also foster biodiversity and ecological balance in a nationally recognized estuary of critical importance. And let’s not forget the miles of interconnected paths—more than mere trails, they are pathways to community engagement. Whether walking, running, or cycling, these routes will connect us to nature, history, and each other. They will invite exploration, exercise, and moments of reflection, reinforcing the park’s role as a shared space for all. As we look forward, envisioning Liberty State Park as a model of sustainable urban park design—one that balances active recreation, arts, culture, and environmental stewardship—is invigorating and I urge the task force and the NJDEP to keep Liberty State Park exactly that, a park and not a commercial venue.",rtdasilva88@gmail.com

This isn’t about anything but keeping people of color and those that lack  financial means from enjoying a space that should serve all. Let’s stop cloaking racism behind political bickering.

Lynn Mullins,,"I have been utilizing the open space at Liberty State park for many years, except when there are firework displays. Who wants to wait in that horrendous traffic?  Building one or two huge stadiums that would be used for concerts would create the exact same traffic nightmare.  Not just for people who live quite close to the park, it would affect people driving towards Hudson County and New York City.  Additionally it would create mayhem for light rail passengers. I don't really see how this idea benefits anyone except concert promoters. 

The attempt at seizing Liberty State for Paul Fireman's personal gain is so clearly obvious here.   Because he has money to spread around to influence leglislators, we presently do not  have a protect Liberty State Park act.  For years he has had a posh golf course with promises to give back to the immediate area and he has done nothing.   People use Liberty State Park for walking, birthday parties, playing ball, cycling and enjoying the view, exactly the kind of things a park should be used for.  Please move forward considering the thousands of people who use the free space in LSP and don't have the money to spend on trying to convince people of their interests.  Privatization is not a plus for out of town visitors to LSP or the people of Jersey City.   Privatization of Liberty State Park is not a plus for Jersey City or for NJ.  A few ball fields or other recreation areas that would benefit the local population is acceptable, especially since the administration of Jersey City has done little in that area for public recreation programs.   I understand that no other state parks include recreational fields for local team sports, but Jersey City is more interested in facilitating building apartments for the wealthy instead of children's recreational needs. 

Thank you",troubledreply@hotmail.com
Robert Fretz,,"First, thank you for leading a transparent process to this point. I echo the sentiment from the hearing that 5 million visitors a year wouldn't happen if the park wasn't meeting a significant need in its present form. While there are areas of improvement needed and welcomed, maintaining the flexibility of the space must be paramount in planning. Permanent structures like stadiums and bleachers that can't be utilized in another manner when there are no games should be a non-starter. Every permanent structure lying dormant takes away from the flexibility that has made the park so inviting to millions of visitors every year.

It is extremely important to take a real look at the financial implications of limited use permanent structures as it applies to long term financial health and stability of the park's overall budget. Jersey City has not been able to generate the local demand to keep stadiums, performance venues, or even nationally recognized sports institutions afloat. Those resorting to well documented misinformation about this process are aware of that fact. Without a demonstrated regional or statewide demand, it seems irresponsible to add the financial burden of limited use permanent structures to the park's budget. This is particularly true if those structure's best case use scenarios, on weekends and summer months, will also negatively impact the experience of the millions who visit the park without these structures existing presently.

While I am generally opposed to permanent limited use facilities, even in reclaimed areas, I am very much in favor of a serious revamping of transportation options within the park to avoid paving open space. As someone who has arrived at the park via the light rail pushing a stroller to the waterfront, ridden to Caven Point from the Heights with my daughter, and arrived numerous times in numerous ways for a myriad of reasons, I know getting around the park can be challenging. At a minimum, a shuttle from the light rail station would help bring those who cannot drive or ride in enjoy the open space they may not otherwise be able to get to. 

This is particularly crucial for the southern improvements, which has no public transit option. As someone who has used the park and attended annual events in and adjacent to the park (Fleet Week, PGA, LPGA, etc.), those existing influxes of people already demonstrate the challenges of increased traffic in and around the park during peak times. Anything drawing more people to the park must put not drawing additional cars at the forefront of planning. Also, facilities like the aquatic center need to make sure the community can actually get to them, which as currently proposed would be a significant challenge to the estimated 40% of Jersey City households that lack cars. 

Finally, I have great hope for restoring the piers on the south end and the continued protection of Caven Point. The piers and Caven Point are regular stops, with this year being the first I've seen harbor seals after years of trying. The exposed rebar made me reluctant to take our youngest out to see them, but the nine that were there was spectacular with a zoom lens. In addition, our family and many others we know rely on Caven Point for the chance to ""walk through the woods"" observing birds and various paw prints in our city that otherwise lacks woodland trails.  The trails may not be long, but they can't be replicated elsewhere in the city, particularly ending at a great spot for a picnic and throw shells into the water.

Jacqueline O'Brien,,"Dear DEP Task Force, 
I attended the recent public meeting in LSP on the topic of revitalization and was dismayed to observe the members of the ironically-named “People’s Park Foundation” depart BEFORE the public comments on the agenda even began.  These people, who have deservedly earned their excellent reputations in JC community athletics, seem all too willing to sully and sacrifice their good names in support of a billionaire who cares for nothing except the revenue he can generate from a vulnerable, natural resource in our midst.  

What made such a sight even more upsetting is that these folks departed shortly after two of the members suggested that an “executive session” be held. 

It is a slap in the face to the many tireless, working-class, hearts-in-the-right-place folks who unselfishly dedicate their time and energy to preserving a rare natural gem in Jersey City’s crown for EVERYONE, not just for cronies of billionaire.  The members of the PPF seek to exploit and replace this natural urban oasis with a synthetic, pollution-and-traffic generating commercial monster.  That’s it.

Destroying what is truly the last natural frontier on this side of the Hudson is not the answer.   There ARE other options for creating a viable venue for the sorely-needed athletic resources for our youth.  It is the City’s responsibility to identify and allocate the necessary lands to pursue such a virtuous goal. 

The DEP must seek to uphold the “P” in its name.  Otherwise, it should consider changing the acronym to “DEE,” with the last “e” standing for “exploitation” and/or “extermination.”

Thank you for your consideration.  It is truly my fervent hope that this task force uphold its original plans for LSP (i. e.  Interior habitats plan, a flood resiliency plan with wetlands, open space and miles of paths).

Eileen Ferara,,"Phase 1B - It is important for the recreation areas to be accessible to all. Is there a plan for use of the fields by rec. teams/local schools, open time for pick up games? How about transporting groups to use the fields? I know that there are some local places where the fields are locked up and sit empty for most of the time, making the recreation space only available to a few, so it is important to have the field managed. 

Phase 2 - Track and field, skatepark and a community pool all sound great - same comments as far as accessibility to maximize use. Having a small concession (like many of the swim areas at State Park Lakes) would be good. Hopefully there will still be lots of open space for picnics and grilling. Also, I think it is very important to leave wild space with trails for the flora and fauna, and preserve Caven Point for wildlife habitat and education programs by the park rangers. 

It was discouraging to see such a large swath of the park razed of most trees and plants across from the Science Center. I do hope that this means there are remediation and plantings scheduled for this year, otherwise, it is likely to come back with a lot of the phragmites and other weed species, and will have to torn up/disrupted again.

We DO NOT need a 5,000 seat stadium. or a 7,000 seat concert venue!!! How would all these people get in and out of the park?!!! To try to imagine this is just so CRAZY!!! 

Our park is beautiful the way it is. We go there for peace and quiet. To enjoy our family, nature, the waterfront. 

We DO NOT need more cars.
We DO NOT need more noise. 
These are NOT improvements.
Only a handful of greedy people want this!

Please DO NOT destroy our park with this madness! We are begging you.

Erik Hartten,,"To whom it may concern,

Hereby this comment, I wish to express my strong support for the current effort to preserve and expand the open space element of the current design of Liberty State Park's (LSP) planned revitalization and my firm opposition to any and all attempts to monetize what is a uniquely precious public good in the name of private commercial recreation and entertainment. 

LSP is the crown jewel in the state's public park system. It provides all New Jerseyans and visitors to our great state both breathtaking views and ""breath catching"" respite from one of the most densely populated urban environments in the country, if not the world. I can think of no other place where one can reach out and almost touch the Statue of Liberty and the New York City skyline, and simultaneously have close encounters with a four-point buck and a herd of does, furtively fastidious muskrats, the soulful calls of Mourning Doves and chatty flocks of migrating Brant Geese. This spectacular intersection of our manmade and natural worlds is one that must be cherished and augmented, not compromised to make room for more conventional activities, which, while they have an important role to play in our community, it is certainly not one that should be inside the boundaries of this fragile parkland. 

I am already dismayed by the heavy bumper-to-bumper traffic that often clogs park roads on weekends and holidays. The introduction of yet more traffic-drawing venues threatens to turn this park into a just another one of our myriad parking lots. While I am all for dedicating a reasonable amount of park space to infrastructure for organized, non-commercial forms of recreation, culture and community education, such as sports, music, history, public art, nature walks, community gardens, etc., this infrastructure should serve the long-term health of the park's natural capital, not short-term monetary gains. 

The park's revitalization is an historic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for today's generation to invest in something truly great that will generate enormous public benefit for generations to come. 

Let's please not squander it! 

Sincerely,
Erik Hartten",thor@hartten.com
Lawrence Ciarallo,,"Good Afternoon,

I am opposed to any commercial venue plans being promoted by Paul Fireman and his paid surrogates on the task force. I firmly support the initial plan put forth by the DEP to continue the remediation of all interior acreage and the development of vital natural habitats in addition to the passive in active recreation in the remaining areas of the park.  

I strongly oppose task force meetings taking place behind closed doors. Liberty State Park belongs to the people and all decisions made about its future should include the public and allow robust debate and input as to how the park can best serve the people of Jersey City, New Jersey and beyond. 

The DEP has presented a strong vision for the park. Both phases address longstanding needs for the park while maintaining its natural beauty.

William Nierstedt,,"My family - both my mother's and my father's -is from Jersey City.  My mother used to take us on the old CRR or Suburban (I think) bus line to Johnson Avenue in Jersey City to catch another bus over to Park Street where my grandparents lived.  I remember how busy the CRR ferry terminal was with NY bound workers getting off the train and walking through the terminal to catch the ferry.  And I remember -even as a kid - the lack of maintenance in the industrial area that surrounded the wooden shack where we would catch the bus.  The 'roads' the bus traveled on in what the Liberty State Park area is today were dirt, gravel, and after rains, puddle strewn.  I don't know if these trips had some influence on me becoming a licensed professional planner, but they might have.  I must have thought, 'Wow, can't NJ do better than this deplorable area directly across the Hudson River from Manhattan'?

I am writing this comment because finally, NJ actually is trying to do something in this area... something that would benefit ALL residents of Jersey City, Hudson County, New Jersey, and given how many people come to Liberty State Park to visit Ellis Island and the Statue of liberty, ALL Americans.  ALL visitors would be able to see and visit this beautiful public park that the NJDEP is designing for the remaining 'undeveloped' acres of the total park area.  That is as soon as the NJDEP and we members of the public can stop selfish billionaire Paul Firestone and misguided Bob Hurley from advancing their ridiculous, out of character, misplaced Sports and Entertainment Complex plan with its exclusionary traffic-jam-causing, admission-fee 5000 seat football stadium & 7000 seat commercial concert venue.  Don't we have enough concrete and pavement in Jersey City already?  Don't the 280,000 Jersey City residents need open space more than they need more air polluting vehicles coming into their backyard?  

I beg you to dismiss this for private profit driven commercial venue, and promote, approve, make happen the NJDEP's science-based open space plan with spectacular Interior habitats for the native wildlife who currently have such a hard time finding adequate habitat in our people populated NY/NJ region, a flood resiliency plan with wetlands, playgrounds, active recreation areas, open space and miles of paths for all New Jersey - but mostly under provided Jersey City - residents to visit, play in and enjoy with their children and grandchildren.

Ronnie Yates,,"RE: Liberty State Park Development
Natural land and open space are scarce in our State of NJ & especially in the vicinity of Jersey City. 
The Governor, Politicians, and Private Groups should NOT be allowed to deface them and decrease the amount that still  exists in any way.

LSP, with its UNIQUE LOCATION, has been and should remain a Natural Parkland with its acreage of open and natural land. It has always been a destination for local City people and for visitors from all over NJ & the World who come to enjoy the open spaces and views of the  Hudson River, NYC & the Statue of Liberty.
  
Elected officials should not be considering to allow any private development of any part of the area which would deface the existing parkland and affect wildlife in their life cycles, the natural open spaces, and the fine views from the parkland, and add to traffic congestion & pollution in the Jersey City area.

Matthew Gulyas,,"As a new citizen to Jersey City, I feel that the utilization of a park meant for all designed for only a few is a terrible plan. The wildlife refuge within the park is important for the biodiversity of the city and the green space allows for absorption of any water should the area flood. The park acts a natural barrier also naturally housing deer and migrant bird species which are important for urban people like myself to interact with nature and know that such nature exists within the boundaries of a heavily urbanized region. Also, I have seen in others areas, the destruction of natural wildlife areas will never get rid of wildlife at all and the park will continue to utilized by animals no matter what. The proposed stadiums and concert venues will need high maintenance to even maintain them and so the cost to do will continuously rise over time due to excrement and waste from animals over time. These projects would lose money in the long run due to these costs. The park should be an open space with trails throughout the wildlife area and along the water front. The terminal can renovated to host community events and teach urban dwellers around the environment and educate others amount watercraft and such sports. The terminal can also serve as a marketplace for things such as farmers markets and full restoration would preserve the history of the park. The uses of public land for private purposes is symptomatic of misuse of city owned land that is meant for interactions with nature and a healthy lifestyle. Any construction of stadiums and other places for private use take away the value of the land from the public and any additional parking would destroy a park that is beloved by all and treasured by the citizens of Jersey City. It is for these reasons that I oppose the new plans by the newly appointed task force to benefit personally from the construction of stadiums and concert venues that would see money pass in their hands and not to the local government for the usage to provide services to citizens who need them the most. A park is something that, while being seen a waste of space to property developers, is treasured and used by citizens in an urbanized area to get away from the hustle and bustle of life and relax in the calm surroundings of nature.

Kerry Barringer,,"The Phase 2 plan does not indicate what is to be done with Caven Point, even though it is marked as being part of that phase.  Any feedback is incomplete until any plans or changes for that area are included.

I do not want the Recreation, Arts, and Culture facilities outlined in Phase 1B or most of the athletic facilities in the Long-term master plan (Phase 2) planned for Liberty State Park.  I think that they would ruin the park; in part, because they would take space away from the thousands of people who regularly already use the park for family reunions, picnics, exercise, and passive recreation.  More importantly, the staffing, upkeep, maintenance, and repair of these facilities would create a large expense, drawing money away from other parks, and creating a huge draw on state and DEP funds.  Money may be available short-term, but facilities like these would require a long-term commitment to a high level of funding.

The DEP has shown that it can manage its funds responsibly and balance the needs of people throughout the state, but funding comes through the legislature and there is no indication of how the legislature will fund the facilities outlined here long-term.  Long term funding will be a necessity.

We have nearby stadiums, entertainment venues, community centers, and athletic facilities that, even when they are more conveniently located than those proposed here, are already underused, underfunded, and in need of maintenance.   Adding more in Liberty State Park will not make the Park better and will not help improve the region.

If any area could be improved, it would be the areas now designated for the 'Community Center' and portion of the 2B near the intersection of Morris Pesin Blvd. and Burma Road.  As you are using it, the 'Community Center' too ambiguous and its use needs to be clarified.  The Burma Road site might be best used as an administrative center as the planned facilities will require a much expanded staff for maintenance, administration, and especially security.",kerrybarringer@gmail.com

Furthermore, LSP is a State Park and by no measure should it be expected to make up for the severe short comings of the Jersey City or Hudson County public park systems.

The initial phases are TOO BIG.  Scale it back.  We don’t need to sign on for the long term costs associated with maintaining facilities that will go unused.

The community center is too far from any school or neighborhood where kids are in need.  We need the community center in Jersey City proper, not in a flood plain.

There is no reason to disrupt the marina parking layout.  That should absolutely be adjusted. 

It is a shame to get rid of the cobblestone on Audrey Zapp.  In general it would be best to discourage vehicular traffic into the park.

Many access their boats year round and at all hours of the day.  Close parking is critical to enable tenants to bring supplies (such as food, beverages, ice, boat parts, gasoline, propane, etc.) to their boats.  Also, many tenants are elderly, very young, and disabled.  Any shuttle vehicle used to bring tenants from remote parking will be inadequate as it will certainly not run 24x7x365 and allow hazardous supplies (such gasoline, propane, marine chemicals, flares, etc.).  Eliminating parking will kill the marina.  LLM is one of the most expensive marinas in the area.  If parking is removed or significantly reduced, boaters will simply move their boats elsewhere.  This will not only harm the marina's business but will also harm Liberty House and Maritime Parc, which receive a lot of business from the marina tenants.  On a nice weekend day during the summer, the parking lot is completely full.  As such, even reducing the number of parking spots by a small amount will not work.  In fact, the current parking would not even support users of the proposed ball fields who will need to bring supplies such as bats, balls, mits, bases, coolers, etc.  The current parking lots are also home to dumpsters used by marina tenants. On any given Sunday evening during the Summer, these dumpsters are full to the top.  Removing the dumpsters, reducing their number, or making them remote will simply result in litter in the park.  People will pile garbage in the dock gate houses and that garbage will be blown by the wind into the park and water.  It should also be noted that if baseballs hit boats, the costs for damages could be extremely high.  Many boats in the marina are worth millions of dollars.  A custom window for such a vessel could cost a fortune to replace.  Traffic on Audrey Zapp Drive is already horrible on a Summer weekend.  Please consider how badly this will increase when ball field users all arrive and leave at around the same time.  Finally, of all the proposals for a large ball field, the one with a single field and track centered on the grass could work provided that large parking areas are also provided on each side of it.  These areas should have the same number of spots as the current lot plus spots for ballfield users.  Thank you.",matttbyrne@usa.net
Johanna Seppalainen,,"1B: We lack swimming pools in Jersey City. There is only one public all year round swimming pool at Pershing Field, and it is not a very good option. During the summer, a lot of people swim at the Lafayette Swimming pool, showing that there is a clear need for this type of exercise in our city. Hence, I would love to see an all year round, indoor swimming pool for the public in the Northern Area Recreation.

Keep it natural, let the wildlife remain. Jersey City has more than enough development throughout the city. LSP is a unique site and if any of the natural habitat is lost, it will be lost forever. Develop and utilize public transport to help those without cars to access the park. So many park users cannot afford to go on vacations or take trips. This park is for many, our only way to be in a natural setting. We don't need another or bigger golf course, we don't need another concert stadium. We do need Liberty State Park's natural and historical setting, a place to see birds, rabbits, and other wildlife.

Lee Widman,,"Northern Athletics Hub within the Liberty State Park Revitalization Program:

Ecological Impact: The construction of the Athletics Hub will significantly alter the existing ecosystem. We must carefully assess the impact on local flora and fauna. Are there plans to mitigate disruption to wildlife habitats and native plant species? This will  compromising the park’s ecological balance.
Loss of Green Space: The Athletics Hub may consume a substantial portion of green space. While active recreation facilities are essential, we should question whether the trade-off is worth it. Can we achieve the same goals without sacrificing valuable natural areas?
Noise and Aesthetics: Sports facilities tend to generate noise—cheering crowds, amplified announcements, and athletic events. How will this affect the park’s tranquility? Additionally, the visual impact of large structures should be considered. Will the hub blend harmoniously with the park’s surroundings?
Community Engagement: Were local residents actively involved in the decision-making process? Community input is crucial to ensure that the hub aligns with the needs and desires of Jersey City residents. Transparent communication and genuine engagement are vital.
Maintenance Costs: Beyond construction, ongoing maintenance costs for the Athletics Hub must be evaluated. Will taxpayers bear the burden, or are there sustainable funding mechanisms? We don’t want a scenario where the hub becomes a financial strain on the park’s overall budget.
Alternative Locations: Could alternative locations outside the park serve as better sites for the Athletics Hub? Balancing recreational needs with environmental preservation might lead us to explore other options.
In summary, while the Athletics Hub aims to enhance active recreation, we must tread carefully. A holistic approach that considers ecological impact, community involvement, and long-term sustainability is essential. Let’s ensure that Liberty State Park remains a cherished green oasis for generations to come. 🌿🏟️",leewidman@gmail.com

Jessica Jamroz,,"Dear Design Task Force,

I am the memorial designer behind Empty Sky: New Jersey's Empty Sky Memorial in Liberty State Park -- the state's official monument of 9/11 remembrance. It is a result of a design competition that I won in 2004 and it is an incomplete work of art. The Empty Sky Memorial needs to be repaired, restored, and completed and should be prior to 2026 -- the 25th anniversary of 9/11, the 50th anniversary of Liberty State Park, and when the World Cup hits New Jersey.


Items to resolve at the Empty Sky Memorial include:  

•	Integrate TRIBUTE to 9/11 responders and survivors, inc those victims succumbing to 9-11 related illness due to the attacks (this is NOT an ""addition"" to the original 2004 memorial design or State request of 9/11 remembrance -- any suggestion otherwise is materially false. Happy to substantiate).
•	Add NJ 9/11/01 victim names currently missing on the memorial walls 
•	Restore 65 autumn weeping cherry TREES (they were killed due to being left in drought conditions and not provided water -- there is an irrigation system embedded in the memorial mound).
•	Restore broken LIGHTING at base of memorial walls to illuminate victims’ names as originally designed
•	Modernize tech (inc QR code) of the DIRECTORY KIOSKS so finding a name is always possible
•	Restore memorial PLAZA where stainless steel ACCESSORIES have been stripped away and replaced with plastic
•	Memorial Preservation Manual (with protocols for things like what to do to add a name).
•	Include an accessible educational component -- including languages other than english. 5+ million international visitors visit the memorial every year, it is a key landmark on the Federal National 9/11 Memorial Trail, the stop before (or after) the National 9/11 memorial and there is no educational component currently at Empty Sky describing its meaning.

Thank you.

It provides natural open green space to relax and be active in nature, which is difficult to come by in a big city and essential for our mental health. I support cleaning up the contaminated areas, creating nature trails and increased public transportation so more people can enjoy the park without adding more traffic to the area. I STRONGLY oppose privatization of any kind including a sports stadium and amphitheater. There's plenty of those around here already.

magda husak,,"Liberty State Park has extremely important role for our over crowded and extremely polluted city, we need there as many trees as we can get so we can get air filtered. Do not forget that we have major road crossing our city with millions of cars per year ( NJ turnpike, 1&9, 139, 7 and 440). Right now it seems that project is too much for a place called ""state park"". Lot 11 should be a green space - this boat parking is an eye soar for years, baseball field is absolutely not appropriate for that park, there should be trail for walking and for jogging, some small fields for tennis, basketball or volleyball are also good. Liberty State Park should not become sport arena, but a place to rest, connect with nature - so more native gardens would be appreciated, more animals/birds observations points. We need a place to breath and relax surrounded by green area.

Recreation areas are currently absent and the proposed solutions seem to cover some of the most common activities. With that said, I'm wondering if placing softball and soccer fields (phase 1B) very close to the water and the boats would create conflict between said boaters and the public. In general the areas north of Audrey Zapp Dr seem to be disconnected from the rest of the park.

There is no reason to take away the only green space that we have to exercise in and enjoy the outdoors.

Daniel Chall,,"When I saw the ""people's park"" rendering a while back, it seemed jam-packed with structures that would be a boon to developers and not to the community, or to the environment. I thought their rendering was satire!  Responsiveness to the community is a great idea, but don't give away this valuable public land to fill the pockets of billionaires. We don't need a huge stadium or a big concert venue.  We don't need anything like a light rail to get around the park. A ""central park for passive outdoor recreation, flexible space for community sports, and critical habitat restoration and flood mitigation"" sounds like a no-brainer. I'd be devastated if Caven Point were taken over to provide a more convenient location of three golf holes to be enjoyed only by the very rich. (That parcel of land isn't earning financial profits, and that makes it a desirable land grab. But the land still has immense value in its current use. Where else can migratory birds find such a habitat? Imagine if Liberty National were to buy out a similar-sized parcel in the neighborhood, at Port Liberte'--the cost would be prohibitive. The location is inherently invaluable. That's the magnitude of the land grab being sought in Liberty National's ""vision"" ($$$) for Caven Point.",danchall@gmail.com

It is regrettable that the Park’s status largely has been uncertain over these decades through a combination of political fecklessness and entrepreneurial greed.  The latest manifestation of this impasse pits a billionaire’s determination to expand a golf course against a principled movement seeking to preserve as much natural habitat as possible while acknowledging the need for some recreation in this urban setting.

I am also impressed with the plans to build additional sports fields as well as other sports courts and recreational facilities.

Henry Pullin,,"I am 38 years old and was born and raised in Jersey City. I attended summer camp at Camp Liberty for many years, from an early age until I basically aged out. I feel like I know this city and Liberty State Park well. Last Sunday, the day after the ""Task Force Meeting"" and public comment session, I took my parents and some family members who were visiting from out of town to Liberty State Park for a walk. We got the full experience of what Liberty State Park has to offer. Along the Hudson River, we saw the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, and the Skylines and bridges of NYC. As we walked along the paths we saw the lawns, playgrounds, memorials, historic sites, remnant sandy beaches, wetland areas, and forested uplands throughout the park. This was my cousins' first time in Jersey City, they were amazed by what Liberty State Park has to offer. They were literally daydreaming out loud about all of the activities they could engage in at Liberty State Park. There were also so many other people in the park when we were there, people that appeared to be from a huge variety of different backgrounds. Many people sounded like they were from other countries based on their conversations and the languages they spoke. People were strolling, riding bikes, playing sports, observing nature, barbecuing, playing on playgrounds, lounging in hammocks, sitting and observing the scenery, and engaging in countless other activities. All these people appeared to be enjoying themselves very much and they all, in their own way, appeared to be connecting with the same nature, history, and culture that my family and I were connecting with. Liberty State Park has always offered visitors access to resources that are extremely difficult to find in the middle of a dense urban area, and based on the number of visitors, the activities they were engaging in, and the spirits in the park last Sunday, it is clear that Liberty State Park, in its current state, is a wildly successful park.

Based on my experience last Sunday I would like to update my public comment. I initially stated that there may be some room for non-commercial sports fields, but I really don't think there is space in the park. At first glance or on an aerial image it may appear like there is space to spare in Liberty State Park but between parking and the field itself sports fields would use up precious park space quickly. Sports fields also severely limit the types of activities people can engage in on the land where they are located. Basically, people are only able to engage in the sport that the field is designed for. Additionally, sports fields are only used during select seasons, at limited hours, and usually require permits to use. To add to the point about limited space in the park, last Sunday, when I visited the park, it was an exceptionally warm and beautiful day after a long winter, the weather probably explains the massive amount of people in the park that day, but this park is a very popular destination year-round. When we were at the park it was very difficult to find parking and when we left it took a very long time to exit the park, traffic was backed up well into the city streets. Adding fields that attract large amounts of attendees, buses, etc. will only further exacerbate this issue. Doing so could potentially make the traffic much worse and this would be very detrimental to the park. There may be some opportunity for smaller courts intended for active recreation but they should be located near existing parking and not be built at the expense of natural areas (Brooklyn Bridge Park features an excellent example of a concentrated active recreation area). For-profit operations, such as sports arenas or other types of venues, should absolutely not be constructed in the park. Also, on a more general level, I would like to echo some of the comments I heard during the public comments session. State parks are designed to protect areas of natural or historic significance, they are not obligated to provide active recreation opportunities to a city, in this case, that is Jersey City or Hudson County's responsibility. The NJDEP's plans to improve the interior of the park, such as the constructed freshwater and saltwater wetlands and other habitats are truly visionary and sustainable. These improvements are in line with the spirit of the park and they expand and enhance successful elements of the park. This is the direction we should be moving with the park.

I would also like to comment on the elephant in the room. The Liberty State Park ""Task Force"" was clearly created through a billionaire's lobbying efforts. This billionaire has also essentially bought off members of the task force as well as other select community leaders through lobbying and ""donations"" to nonprofits. The task force is clearly a proxy group set up to push the goals of the billionaire. This same billionaire has been trying to make land grabs in the park to expand the golf course he owns that is adjacent to the park for years. There is no mistaking that what the park is going through now is an effort by a billionaire to derail well-planned DEP improvements to the park. The billionaire's motivations are not entirely clear but he is likely doing this in an effort to eventually expand his golf course, work his way into some potential business opportunity he sees in the park, simply out of spite, or some combination of these motivations. Whatever his motivations, at this point, there is no reason he shouldn't think he can't achieve his goals, he has already created a government-sanctioned ""Task Force"" to push his agenda and he has brought much of the park planning to a screeching halt and back to square one. Additionally, he is pushing his agenda through the most despicable of ways. By sprinkling in vague accusations of the park not being accessible to some neighborhoods and not accommodating certain types of uses, while actually working to derail the park improvement process to eventually achieve his own personal and financial goals, the billionaire is opportunistically taking advantage of, corrupting, and undermining truly virtuous social justice movements. While there are some legitimate access issues at Liberty State Park, such as difficult access to the park from underserved neighborhoods, this is something the DEP is on working to resolve. The billionaire who has been trying to take park land away from the public for years did not work so hard to raise issues of access, this was done in an effort to create confusion and opportunities for him to achieve his goals. We all know this, I would just like to say that the behavior of this billionaire should not be catered to.

Lastly, many of the amenities, outside of large-scale for-profit stadiums and public sports fields, that task force members and pro-active recreation public commenters expressed concern over the park lacking, already exist in the park. There are heavily used playgrounds and Camp Liberty provides safe, affordable daycare and programming during the summer months. This is not to say that these offerings can't be expanded on, it should just be recognized that they exist already.

In summary: 
- The park is already well-used and successful
- State parks are not required to provide active recreation, active recreation is the city's responsibility
- There is not enough space in the park to develop sports fields (even after areas that are closed to the public are opened)
- Constructing sports fields would be detrimental to wildly successful park elements and create bad traffic congestion
- Improvements should only expand on what is successful in the park already (access to nature and history)
- The personal agenda of a billionaire should never be catered to on public land

The State should act to preserve the environment that makes the Garden State beautiful and safe. Laying down a large swath of plastic alongside the water is irresponsible. That the DEP would allow it is unfathomable.

The citizens of the state should have access to open, natural and safe recreational spaces. There is no denying that. The DEP should act to assure that this is the case. The Design Task Force must create a plan that does not involve covering the earth with hundreds of thousands, if not hundreds of millions of pounds of chemical laden plastic. This should not happen anywhere in the state, especially alongside a waterway.

Does the Design Task Force know how many artificial turf fields are in NJ now? Does the Design Task Force know how many artificial turf fields are being planned in BOE's and municipalities across the state? Does the Design Task Force know all the chemicals that are used to produce the plastic in artificial turf? Does the Design Task Force know how much of the chemicals and plastic will leach into the surrounding waterways? Does the Design Task Force know how many humans, flora and fauna will be adversely affected by the chemicals in artificial turf. These answers are not fully knowable - the research is incomplete.

Mark Uriu,,"Liberty State Park presents a unique opportunity to create a vast park of naturalized wetland, public recreation and athletic facilities on the last large undeveloped tract on NY Harbor. It will provide the urban citizens of this region free access to nature, open space and recreation. It has been proven repeatedly thru history how access to natural settings vastly improves the quality of life in a city, particularly for the folk who don’t have the easy means to get to the country.  Calvert and Vaux, creators of many great urban parks, are rightly held in high esteem.  Commercial concert and sports venues are much better, more interesting and more accessible when they are integrated into an urban street matrix. To place them in Liberty State Park with their requisite parking lots and built up facilities, would be squandering this region’s last great opportunity to create something really special. 

To limit public access to this huge resource through privatization, whether it be to a members only golf course or for a pay to enter sports/concert venue is just plain wrong. There are much more appropriate places for that kind of private enterprise. 

Those who characterize the climate change resiliency features of a naturalized park as “flooding” are factually incorrect and have learned nothing from Superstorm Sandy. It does beg the question, what is motivating this cynical manipulation of facts and why are some of our politicians going along with it? 

The bottom line is that Liberty State Park is uniquely suitable for development into naturalized parkland and low density athletic facilities and not into higher density entertainment venues.

Preserve it for all of us, including the least of us, to enjoy and for which we can all be proud.",Josippie@gmail.com
Brian Goldin,,"I’m a long-time boater in the marina and as representative of the community with some of the most regular access to the park, we understand the importance of maintaining and promoting access to the water. Our collective efforts have brought a wide range of activities to the park, enriching the experiences of visitors and residents alike.

As tenants of the marina, we represent a vibrant community comprising approximately over 500 boats, spanning nearly the entire length of the Morris Canal. Beyond ourselves and neighboring tenants, we also serve as a gateway for a steady stream of visiting recreational boaters, jet skiers, sailing clubs, weekly sailboat racing enthusiasts, fishermen, and numerous small and large charter boats. Our marina provides countless opportunities for residents and tourists alike to access the water and enjoy various aquatic activities.

We are deeply concerned about the proposed changes that could potentially have negative impacts on our community. It is crucial that any revitalization plans take into account the diverse needs and activities facilitated by the marina, ensuring continued access to the water and preserving the unique character of our waterfront environment.

Vehicle Access and Parking: The availability of convenient vehicle access to the marina and well-designed parking facilities is not a luxury but a necessity to ensure the marina's continued functionality and appeal. Adequate parking not only serves the needs of boaters and visitors but also supports the provisioning, servicing, and repair of boats, activities that require frequent trips to parking areas where heavy equipment, supplies, tools and other items need to and from both personal and service vehicles.

Waste Management: Efficient waste management services in the marina area are indispensable to prevent environmental pollution and safeguard the integrity of both the park and its surrounding water bodies. Currently the marina has a large dumpster next to each dock that is often filled to capacity and The current plan's disregard for proper waste disposal provisions raises grave concerns about potential litter and hazardous waste contaminating our water, endangering aquatic life and ecosystems. Adequate vehicle access and robust waste management are fundamental aspects of environmental stewardship, directly aligning with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's mission to protect our state's environment.

User Experience and Economic Development: A well-maintained marina, complemented by seamless vehicle access and essential services, is pivotal for enhancing the overall user experience. Such improvements attract more visitors, fostering positive economic and community benefits. Local businesses, including restaurants, shops, and service providers, benefit from a thriving marina to flourish and contribute to our community's prosperity.

Emergency Services Access: Furthermore, the proposed plan glaringly neglects the critical need for easy access by emergency services, including police, fire, and ambulances, to the marina and its boat slips. In times of emergencies or water-related accidents, swift response times can be the difference between life and tragedy. It is deeply concerning that the current plan falls short in prioritizing unimpeded access for emergency services, a matter of utmost importance that should take precedence in any revitalization endeavor.

Related to Athletics: I have substantial reservations regarding the proposed athletic fields and their proximity to the marina. The proximity of the athletic fields threatens to disrupt marina access, increase traffic and noise levels, contribute to excessive light pollution, and potentially compromise the visual appeal and tranquility of the marina. It seems that the planners may be attempting to fit the athletic fields into a space that is too small to accommodate them adequately, raising several significant concerns that should be carefully addressed.

I’m concerned that the current plans divert from the Liberty State Park's core essence captured in the 1978 planning document, which emphasized its identity as a place of natural beauty and serenity. Given its status as a state park with national significance, I firmly believe that the park should remain committed to preserving its natural landscape, offering scenic views, and fostering an environment that celebrates nature. Introducing athletic fields may compromise the park's natural integrity, and I urge that careful consideration be given to the original vision for Liberty State Park.

Liberty State Park's unique beauty and historical significance deserve to be upheld for future generations to cherish. I appeal to all stakeholders involved in the revitalization plan to consider these concerns seriously and work collaboratively towards a solution that honors the legacy and future of Liberty State Park.

I'd be happy to meet with the task force to discuss these ideas and to help in any way that I can.",briandgoldin@gmail.com

You cannot fund and accept artificial turf. It’s a product that the Mount Sinai Children’s environmental health center and countless other public health experts have advised a moratorium on. It’s the biggest single source of microplastics, it’s full of PFAS, and it’s an impervious surface that is 20-40 degrees hotter than ambient temperatures. 

If you install thousands of square feet of this poison on our earth, I truly won’t have any hope left.

Gene Stoveken,,"I am very happy and looking forward to seeing the parks transformation . As an avid visitor to the park ,there is no way commercialized stadiums are in the parks best interest . A few things I hope will make it into the design , are  more  affordable options for a family visiting the park to enjoy something to eat . The current restaurants are beautiful , but for a family of four looking to enjoy a small bite to eat or drink , those restaurants are really not an option, some kind of concession stand like what was here in the past would be nice .  Another addition I think would benefit the park , is a covered stage with electricity for concerts and possibly theatrical   plays in the park . A covered stage would benefit the musicians and there equipment in the heat of summer , also ,with already having permanent electricity  it would eliminate the need for gas powered generators which are currently used .  This past years Tuesdays summer  concert series , had a mobile stage from Jersey City , it was the smaller stage that the musicians were sitting on top of each other .

Joseph Seaman,,"I am a long-time resident of Jersey City.

Liberty State Park is just that a ""State"" ""Park"" belonging to the people of ""New Jersey"" and not the special interests of a billionaire real estate developer. It holds an important place in not only the history of New Jersey but also the country. It remains one of the last substantial open space in Norther New Jersey and as such should remain so. The land does not belong solely to the residents of Jersey City and the greater New Jersey community should be considered. The Park is situated adjacent to the State of Liberty and Ellis island National Parks, and does not and should be developed as Recreation Facility serving Jersey City that the city does not need, despite the self serving arguments in opposition to the DEP's plan. The group back by Fireman, has preyed and continues upon the people of Jersey City, using them as pawns in his efforts to execute a major land grab that can not and should not be permitted. The DEP's plan takes a farm more holistic approach to this historic site, providing for some of those recreational needs of the local residents, while maintaining open space and restoring and repurposing some of the historical structures in the park. The alternative plan proposed by Fireman proposes to develop far too much of the existing open space, proposing facilities far in excess of the needs of the community and the state, while paving over much needed open space. The oppositions arguments that their paln will provide facilities to urban residents that exist in the suburbs is fiction, as there are no such facilities the size and scope proposed anywhere in the state. Rather the development should be viewed through the lens of protecting and providing the green space to the urban communities that suburban New Jersey residents enjoy and should be protected and maintained and celebrated at whatever cost.",josephpseaman@gmail.com
Lisa Simms,,"Phase 1B – Audrey Zapp Corridor
There is way, way too much crammed into a very small area of the park. It is excessive. Football, soccer, little league, tennis, basketball and an event lawn. Where will all these folks park? The lights and noise will be horrific. How does this have anything to do with enjoyment of a state park? A lot of editing should be done. One multi-purpose field is sufficient. No skate park in or near the Grove of Remembrance. There is a skate park right up the street from LSP in Barry Lane Park. No viewing areas, and no new paths crisscrossing the Grove! There are more access routes going through the 9/11 Grove of Remembrance, Millenium Park and the LSP north side than there are in the entire 151 acres of the interior. It is way, way too much. The 9/11 Grove of Remembrance has two excellent paths - one paved, active path and one meandering, passive walkway. That is more than enough. Neither the Grove nor the park needs a train. What happened to Never Forget? 

A bicycle path could be constructed next to Audrey Zapp Drive as long as the roots of the mature, 20-year-old Grove of Remembrance trees, which are providing huge environmental benefits, are not destroyed. Perhaps a floating bike path? Innovation with a focus on demonstrating environmentally sound park improvements should be the plan here.  Every path and road should be made of porous pavement. The removal of ANY 20-year-old tree defeats the purpose of environmental sustainability and environmental justice for Jersey City folks. Innovative, sustainable ideas, please. 

The task force had some nice ideas for the train shed, but again, editing is needed. Folks spend entire days in Central Park because it has SOME activities, and many passive activities. No one NEEDS 150 activities in a park. Editing, please. Lots of it.

Phase 2A
Southern Athletic hub
It would seem prudent to fast-track the active recreation component of the Phase 2A. This would create the much demanded active recreation while taking pressure off the rest of the park for ballfields, courts, etc. Make the cleanup and design of this area a priority and focus to alleviate most, if not all, of the active recreation demands. The southern side of the park, in those 50-acreas designated for active recreation, should be the hub of recreation. There’s more parking to accommodate this. The task force members who truly care about Jersey City youth, should decide what kind of recreation will be installed in the southern hub. The quieter area of LSP should be the northern side. 

Phase 2B
 The “existing boat launch area” green space along Morris Pesin Drive from Freedom Way to the Burma Road Grove is filled with trees planted by the NJ Tree Foundation & Friends of Liberty State Park. Starting in 2006 and continuing until about 2019, a diversity of trees (both species and age) were planted to create shade for picnicking and relaxing. As such, many of those trees have been in the ground for 15 years and are supplying much needed ecological benefits. No redesign of any kind should happen in this buffer area.

The waterfront area should be left alone. Liberty State Park is not Six Flags. Plant trees. Shade the walkways. End of story. And, at all costs, PROTECT CAVEN POINT! 

The task force should NOT be allowed to meet in privacy. Full stop. Every minute of every conversation should be open to the public and videotaped. No closed ‘executive sessions’. You could tell from some of the task force members comments that they “felt the cameras” – this is a good thing, creating open, honest dialog that is so important to a community-based process. No closed sessions. Also, task force members should be required to stay until the last community member has spoken. No exceptions. If they cannot remain to hear what the community wants, then they should not be on the task force. Additionally, task force members should come to the meetings prepared – not reading the 174 pages of public input is unacceptable. This is an important commitment and should be taken seriously.",LSimms@njtreefoundation.org
Gary Murphy,,"I strongly support the DEP’s plan for Liberty State Park.  The plan strikes a balance between the needs for both active and passive recreational opportunities.

Mark Trainer,,One more comment from a recently submitted comment. I believe a large dog park perhaps in the interior Millennium Park area would be a great amenity for the community. There are not any other very large dog parks in Jersey City that I'm aware of which allow dogs to really roam and this would be a perfect location to complement the other proposed uses.,mark.trainer1@gmail.com
Mark Trainer,,"Hello,

Overall, I'm very excited about the plans for Liberty State Park and think it is heading in the right direction by balancing passive nature with active recreation and community-orientation at the north end. My specific comments are below.
- I prefer the original concept for the North Athletics Club over the proposal alternatives. There is a dearth of large spaces for healthy active recreation in Central Jersey City and this is an ideal location in a beautiful setting. I'm especially supportive of the running track and soccer field in this location to appeal to the broadest potential user base. I think it makes sense to keep this section of the northern park as the sports focused area with more passive areas elsewhere. I also believe the boat yard should be repurposed to a more community-wide benefitting use if possible.
- I prefer the South of Cove Amphitheater option. This will provide amazing skyline and park views and I think it will feel less congested than including it on the north side next to the beach. I prefer the wood bench on grass terraces seating option as it has a more natural feel than the concrete.
- On transportation, I believe we should encourage non-car modes of travel to the greatest extent possible and repurpose some of the proposed parking spaces toward passive green space. I support a robust shuttle system and think there should be significant investment in making a pleasant transfer experience from both the Liberty State Park light rail station and Grove Street PATH station.
- On Phase 2, I believe the focus should be on supporting more unstructured recreational opportunities and the ability to escape from the City. I think some athletic facilities at the Southern Athletics Hub make sense but that the rest of the area should be more passive in focus.

The park is a truly special place where children like my toddler can play safely, roam free, and observe wildlife in person.

Max Dickman,,"To whom it may concern,

I am deeply concerned and frankly outraged that any plan to develop the area of Liberty State Park into commercial indoor sports venues for private profiteering off public land is even being considered. LSP is an important public use outdoor space and wildlife refuge, and it's crucial that it remain that way. I'd like to voice my overwhelming support for the DEP plan to create a wildlife refuge and passive recreation, open to the public, for visitors of the park. 

Not only is the park a wildlife refuge, it's also at severe risk for flooding. Developing concrete structures and sidewalks puts the entire downtown Jersey City area at worse risk of flooding by removing a large water drainage area. We cannot allow a billionaire to destroy the ecosystem for wildlife and people by developing on this land. 

All in all, entertaining the outlandish notion of constructing privately held arenas, rinks, and other concrete monstrosities on public green space is absolutely ridiculous. Under no circumstances can the beauty and vibrancy of Liberty State Park be destroyed in favor of paid indoor entertainment.

Friends of Liberty State Park,,"Friends of LSP PHASE 2 statement on Freedom Way Corridor and Pesin Drive Corridor and also Opposing Structured Active Recreation in the Phase 2 “Freedom Way Corridor” of the Waterfront Great Green Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk, and north to south between ferry lot and gravel road just before Nature Center.

This statement doesn't include the already planned Phase 1A  and doesn't address at this point, the 50 acres of free active recreation on south side of the Interior.

“Freedom Way Corridor” recommendations
Maybe there’s space for another sensibly located playground and shaded picnic tables to be near a shuttle bus stop but not interfering with Green Park's 88 acre festivals footprints. Also there needs to be the safest bike paths possible in both directions of Freedom Way (it was suggested to perhaps lessen the space on Freedom Way islands for those bike paths as it'd be hard to do with the ""Belgian blocks"" having been installed on the eastern side of Freedom Way). Also water fountain stations along Freedom Way and if possible next to Liberty Walk.

""Morris Pesin Drive” corridor
 The main entrance to LSP with Lady Liberty 2000 feet away from the Scenic Overlook South Lawn. LSP’s south side is the Non-Commercial Family and Friends Picnicking Side of LSP! It mainly needs creative rehabilitation of the 3 historic jetties for walking, fishing, signage, etc.(easternmost jetty has a tiny beach for kayak launching). The southside picnic tables are new since Sandy; the playground is 5 years old, and what google maps is calling the “Pesin Drive Grove” of about 158 trees the Friends planted between the boat launch lot 2 and lot 3 is getting increasingly more popular for picnics and barbecues- especially with the original picnic table area by the office filled up on nice weekends. Also, the sidewalk along LSP’s southside and by the original picnic table area is overdue for renovation.

On the Great Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk:
LSP’s priceless waterfront 88-acre Great Lawn must be preserved for its essential and irreplaceable purpose of green free urban scarce open space in the ""Freedom Way Corridor"". 

The funded surrogates of billionaire Fireman will likely push sports facilities for the 88-acre Waterfront Great Green Lawn - despite the 50 acres promised in LSP’s interior and some acres along Zapp Dr. and in southside’s lot 1.
It'd be like building sports facilities in Central Park's ""Great Lawn”. NYC residents would not accept that for one second! LSP’s Waterfront Great Green Lawn – the Green Park - is essential for varied urban open space activities and periodic special event festivals.
Structured active recreation sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Green Lawn would cast aside LSP’s primary purpose as a public, green, free, urban scarce, priceless open space for unstructured active recreation, passive recreation and nature enjoyment. It would be an obscene crime to assault the most important urban open space lawn in the USA! 

An editorial once stated that the dramatic, panoramic view from LSP is the ""signature view of our civilization” - American soul-stirring and heart-stirring views from the Great Green Lawn's open space. The waterfront lawn, known as the ""Green Park”, is one of the most important urban open space lawns in the world with the dramatic vistas toward NYC, Lady Liberty, Ellis Island and river/bay - going east to west between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk and including Freedom Way’s playground, and going north to south between the ferry parking lot and cherry tree hill by the Nature Center. 

That waterfront lawn is deserved by future generations of urban people for their quality of life for unstructured active recreation and passive recreation, and is crucial for periodic special events which raise some revenue and bring people to the park to enjoy cultural events such as the past Star-Ledger Jazz Festival, All Points West rock festival, kite festivals, last year's Juneteenth festival, Veuve Clicquot Polo event etc. Sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Lawn would prevent/interfere with a needed footprint for use of the Green Ring and Crescent Lawn areas for large special events which sometimes go northward toward the large playground.

The best plan for structured active recreation is the 50 interior acres, the lawn by the marina (but not taking away boaters’ parking spaces, and the 2 acres in southside’s Lot 1.

All of LSP including the waterfront Great Green Lawn is our urban backyard and America’s Great Lawn and is an essential emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual public health resource -an urban haven, oasis, refuge, sanctuary and escape for people to get away from the crowded, congested, and noisy Jersey City. Overwhelmingly expressed in 47 years of battles is that LSP’s urban green open space is its highest, best, and wisest use for now and future generations- for unstructured active recreation such as, walking, running, biking, pick-up games, playgrounds, kids running free in grass, families and friends kicking or throwing balls, kites, dog-walking, etc., and passive recreation like picnics, BBQs, relaxing on benches and blankets, birding, view-watching and taking scenic photos.

Festivals are awesome LSP cultural uses but only done periodically so LSP doesn’t become the PNC Arts Center with every weekend traffic jams blocking access to regular LSP users on summer weekends -no matter how many shuttles. LSP is already jampacked on all nice weekends and the habitats and trails, active recreation, Terminal re-use is coming.

Many urban residents have no front yard or backyard and may go away for a day or two to the beach in the summer but we don't have summer homes and LSP visits are the highlight of people's lives - to come alone, or with family or friends to chill, bond, play, create memories.

In the ""briefing"" document for this travesty task force (established by the billionaire's LSP law), Commissioner Shawn LaTourette’s first line was that LSP is one of the few remaining contiguous open green spaces along the highly developed northern NJ/NYC waterfront.

I'm sure people anywhere who had a Great Lawn facing NYC’s skyline and the Statue of Liberty, harbor, etc. would want to keep the Great Lawn as it is, with soul-soothing walkways and bikeways, gardens, and trees (but not trees in middle of unstructured active rec open space ).",friendsoflibertystatepark@gmail.com
Peter Madison,,"Liberty State Park is a treasure. Beautiful open spaces, relaxing atmosphere. Comparable to New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park. Although there are other parks in Jersey City there are none that are nearly as open and beautiful. In addition, it provides habitat to wildlife, which is increasingly under threat from urban and suburban development.
Its large open spaces also provide a buffer against coastal flooding, which is going to get worse as the climate warms.
All of these benefits would be destroyed by the large spectator sports and concert venues which are being proposed.

The proposal for constructing one or even two multi-seat stadiums is an attack on the very nature of the park--a jewel to be polished but at the same time preserved for us and our children and grandchildren. 
My only practical suggestions are 1) to study closely the best means of safe entry and exit for cars, pedestrians and bikers at both ends of the park as well as transit through the park, and 2) to take into account and incorporate into the historical displays in the terminal building the remarks made by the Rutgers Professor from Newark about the early history of the park (the massacre if indigenous people in the 17th century and the labor of slaves in the eighteenth century).",cr_puglisi@yahoo.com

Sam Pesin,,"hi DEP staff,
Balaam on the task force, I registered presume so I can enter a comment. I wasn't allowed to read my statement at the task force meeting to save time but I was told that I could speak during the public comment portion but I decided not to with the meeting going till 4:30. So here's my statement for the public record on behalf of the Friends of Liberty State Park and myself at the task force member:  I'll start by stating that it was sickening that task force members who have gotten Fireman money and at least three of the political patronage appointees left before the public speaking:
                     
The Friends of LSP strongly support the responsible, inclusive, democratic DEP Revitalization” process of professional park-design planning consultants presenting proposals for essential robust public participation input, and also input from this task force. The Friends are serving under protest on this travesty task force.

The task force was set up in the fast-tracked law passed by billionaire Paul Fireman’s lobbyists and the task force includes his two front groups, heads of nonprofits he’s funded, others who support the Sports and Entertainment Complex"" and some misinformed political patronage appointees. As reported in the news, Fireman's front group headed by Hurley has revived their Sports and Entertainment Complex assault on the park with this new version being a 5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue.

His front groups pushed lies and smear attacks to kill the LSP Protection Act and for two years and pushed their exclusionary, traffic-jam causing, admission-fee Sports and Entertainment Complex plan which cast aside decades of the overwhelming broad public consensus, by many 10’s of 1000’s of people wanting a Central Park type Park. The Protection Act which would’ve protected the Caven Point Natural Area which Fireman still wants and would’ve banned the destructive Sports and entertainment Complex.  The Protection Act had 33K petition signers & 111 Coalition groups. 
The Commissioner thankfully and heroically rejected their public land grab last May but with zero respect for the public land behind LSP, they’ve revived it and ignore that the DEP has promised 60 acres for free structured active recreation. This billionaire’s task force is a shameful symbol of our democracy right behind Lady Liberty by his assault on this free public land by Fireman colluding with bought off puppets and politicians.",pesinliberty@earthlink.net

This is an obvious attempt to grab profit and influence off of an unnecessary development project that would (1) disrespectfully destroy a pristine, untouched gem of land along the mouth of the Hudson River (with the world’s best view of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan), with no close duplicate or equal on Earth, (2) waste city resources on a highly expensive, completely unnecessary project that would create barriers to access of this precious, public land, and (3) fly in the face of clear public opinion on the issue. We have very little green space in this city, state and region of our country, and public spaces are critically important to the mental health of city residents, both rich and poor. For further clarity, without Liberty State Park’s vast, freely accessible acreage, I would genuinely not want to live in Jersey City anymore - I could afford to do so financially (though others with lesser means would continue to be squeezed out of public enjoyment of their own land, which is despicable), but approval of Mr. Fireman’s plan would clearly demonstrate to me that Jersey City is not serious about protecting its only nature sanctuary; worse yet, it would illustrate that this city would auction off its only meaningful public land to make some extravagantly wealthy developers a few more bucks, seemingly only in exchange for political backing and an excuse to trumpet the city’s “accomplishment” in making the city somehow more “luxurious” and “desirable”. The park is desirable as is and many of my friends of similar age and means have also expressed that they would leave Jersey City if Fireman’s plans are approved. There are plenty of other towns in New Jersey, New York, the US, and the world that prioritize public land, access to nature and the associated mental health aspects therewith (including my hometown of Tewksbury Township, NJ). Your tax base will leave you if you move forward with Paul Fireman’s plan - the ball is now in your court to choose. Thank you for your consideration.",mikecoiro7@gmail.com

Please understand that my family and everyone we know are hugely supportive of the state’s phase 1A, 1B, and 2 plans. Fireman’s plan for a commercial sports and entertainment complex is not what we’re looking for.

Kerry Bass,,"Hello - my name is Kerry Bass and I'm the chair of Sustainable Verona in NJ. I would urge you to google the University of Barcelona study of water samples taken between 2014 and 2021. Artificial turf grass accounted for 15% of larger plastics found in samples within about a half-mile of the shoreline.  As the artificial grass breaks down, small pieces of plastic make their way into soil and waterways, contributing to plastic pollution. Ocean plastics like those near Barcelona threaten animals and ecosystems. For example, birds, fish, and turtles mistake plastic for prey. Their stomachs can become lined with it, causing them to starve. They may also suffer from infections, cuts, internal injuries, and reduced swimming abilities.

And that's only one of the things that our team has discovered wrong with artificial turf.  Artificial turf causes more injury than natural grass. There is a study that looked at 53 articles published between 1972 and 2020. The studies concluded higher rates of injuries on turf. The president of the NFL Player's Union posted a letter stating that artificial turf is harder on the body than natural grass. The studies all point to more injuries with artificial turf.

Most recently, a Philadelphia Inquirer article postulated the risk between artificial turf and cancer. Those risks should cause great concern.

I would urge you to take a look at the studies and literature out there highlighting all the problems with artificial turf. The general public is not aware of these problems, and only sees shiny new fields. As planners and designers, it is your duty to take all of the downsides into consideration. Wouldn't it be great if Jersey City could take the lead in enhancing our environment rather than causing it more harm?",kerrybass@verizon.net
Eric Allen Conner,,"In addition to my oral advocacy today, I wish to say that, in addition to wetland restoration to help mitigate flooding risk, there should be no further permanent expensive structures built in the park as they will necessitate costly repairs in the eventual storm surge of the next hurricane.

I did appreciate the comment that the Phase 2 athletic hub be composed of configurable and modular infrastructure to respond to flexible and ever-changing needs in our diverse state. 

Additionally, on Phase 1B, I think it best to put tennis or racquet courts on that northern cove lot for three reasons: 1) helps shave down but doesn’t eliminate marina parking; 2) once they’re in there, they’re relatively low-cost and resilient infrastructure that is in popular demand; and 3) it will make it harder for a future administration to rip them out in favor of another type of sporting facility due to loss aversion. 

In short, but the least offensive stuff in now, get the community using it, and that will protect the park into the future. Human psychology is the DEP’s friend here.",ericallenconner@gmail.com

While Phase 1A and 1B seem like terrific additions , the private complex almost seems to cancel this benefits out.

James Sanderson,,"I attended the Liberty State Park Design Task Force meeting today, 3/2/24, and would like to, yet again, register my strong opposition to the proposed 7000 seat stadium and the 5000 seat auditorium that would take up the entirety of the undeveloped central section of the park.  While I applaud the provisions for the wide range of various community athletic activities proposed for the northern and southern ends the of the park and the cultural uses for the train shed, devoting such a huge portion of the land to only two enormous venues (namely the stadium and the auditorium) would monopolize entirely too much space that cannot then be used for a lot of other purposes.  Not everyone who uses Liberty State Park is into athletics.  Some people enjoy just taking long walks amidst unobstructed scenery or hanging out while contemplating the beauty of nature.  Another issue is that, if 5000 or 7000 cars try all at once to get onto the two-lane roads servicing the area surrounding Liberty State Park after a big concert or tournament, the congestion would be unimaginable.  Even as it is now, without the stadium or the auditorium, traffic on the back roads can jam up for miles during rush hour.  The stadium and the auditorium would simply worsen the problem.  The stadium and the auditorium would also obstruct the view of the skylines, the bay and the Statue of Liberty.  In a part of the country where there is already a decreasing amount of open space, Liberty State Park offers an oasis for people who need to get away from urban sprawl for a few hours.  I also wish to register my opposition to any plans to turn Caven Point into a golf course.  This wildlife habitat needs to be preserved.  I go to Liberty State Park two or three times each week and consider it a priceless resource to protect and cherish, not just for myself but for the Hudson County community, the nation and for the world travelers that put the park on their must-see lists.  We stand at a critical decision point in the redevelopment of the park, and we have only one chance to get it right.  Sean LaTourette is a conscientious leader who is making every effort to take a balanced approach for the benefit of the most people concerned.  Bravo for his efforts.",jamesgsanderson@aol.com
Scott Moulaison,,"Liberty State Park should remain a treasured public resource, free for all to enjoy.

Regarding today's presentation, I not support the inclusion of athletic fields in Liberty State Park. While I understand the desire to provide opportunities for youth woefully served by Jersey City, I think such an action will only encourage the city to continue to ignore their responsibilities.I also think such facilities will be difficult to manage and maintain. If however, athletic fields must be included, they should be built inland, away from the water, and in places with easy access from outside the park. There should be minimal, if any, cost for youth teams to utilize such fields should they be built. 

Parking and public transportation improvement, as well as traffic impact on surrounding communities should continue to be studied and discussed,

The cannot be any major private concert venues constructed in LSP. Any stages should be constructed to fit into the natural environment, be as unobtrusive as possible, and accessible to all.

Lastly, I believe that all subsequent Design Task Force meetings, and indeed any meetings relevant to the future of LSP,  remain open to the public.

We still enjoy it today. LSP is a historic treasure and should remain a free, green, open space for all.  It must never be privatized.

Daniel Letts,,"As a lifelong visitor to LSP who has lived in Jersey City since 2017, I strongly support the DEP plan as is. This park belongs to the entire state, not a billionaire whose ulterior motives are clear as day, nor even to a select group of Jersey City residents who think it belongs solely to them.

The plans put forth by the People’s Park Foundation and their acolytes would irreparably change what is one of the country’s true hidden gems. It seems their only goal is to cram as much concrete and as many fields as humanly possible. If they want to found a northern version of IMG Academy, their billionaire financier is welcome to do so — but not on public land that belongs to the entire state. They could not care less about preserving the natural element of the park - which is precisely what makes it so beautiful and so unique.

The DEP plan, which even the PPF praised until their boss told them otherwise, perfectly balances the need for passive and active recreation. Please keep LSP as is.",daniel.j.letts@gmail.com
Robert Smith,,"1. The NJDEP must ensure the public that the 240 contaminated acres must be properly cleaned and remediated. The money has been available for 12 years. Clean the contamination now. Do it properly so people in jersey city don’t get sick 

2. There has been no official report that has been published that proves bringing water in the park will prevent flooding in surrounding Jersey City. Publish the documents from the Army Corp (they were present at the ribbon cutting) that show Phase 1a will not prevent flooding in the city. Data rules, not words from elected officials. Publish the data from the state engineers. We do not need more flooding in the city. 

3. We need more active recreation. I understand jersey city government is the issue. The city government has forgotten its citizens, but this is an urban park with 300k plus people living around the park. Open it up for active recreation and a community center. We need a community center. The kids need an outlet and there is 600 acres in the park. 

4. The notion of commercialization and making money off the park by Paul Fireman is absurd. Sam Pesin and the friends have receive checks from many events that come in LSP. Polo Classic $50k to FOLSP. Tough Mudder 10k check. Who is profiting off the park. Let’s ask Mr. Pesin. All money that comes to this park should be plowed back in to the park. LSP is running an annual deficit. Money should not line Sam Pesin’s pockets. Make it go back in the park. 

5. We need bathroom and concession stands. We talk about a Central Park like park. Well Central Park has bathrooms, coffee shops, 21 baseball fields, tennis courts, pickle ball, basketball, tennis, handball, a museum and a zoo. People pay money to use the boats on the lake and go to the zoo. Not everything in life is free and money then goes to run and update the facilities. 

Central Park is a gem. LSP is a lump of coal that could be a diamond but will need much attention, care, investment and foresite. LSP is not a preserve it’s a park. A park is for the people. LSP can provide everything.

Clara Richardson,,"I approve the DEP plans you presented today for LSP; thank you for resisting the commercial interests that seek development in the park. Urban humans have a deep and real need for open green space and access to nature. Some active recreation areas for local youth is a good compromise for this location. [Artificial turf needs to be avoided for all the reasons stated. It is essentially poisonous to the land -including the fish that the anglers come to the park for.] I even find myself approving the idea for an amphitheater, as proposed, fitting into the land.

Any confusion (or disinformation) about the wetlands plan demonstrates the lack of understanding of the importance of wetlands in the first place. That makes their inclusion even more important -- along with some good signage!

Over the long term, the 'greatest deficit' of this region will increasingly be open green space and access to nature. Liberty State Park is uniquely positioned to be that asset. As precious and worth fighting for as it is now, just think how much more uniquely valuable it will become as this area becomes even more highly populated.

Cynthia Sanford,,"Thank you for this opportunity to comment.  (I couldn't figure out how to raise my hand online for a phone comment.)  I fully agree with the overwhelming tide of public opinion today that favors open green space--green space that is true to the park's natural state as possible.  People who study education and child development say that exposure to nature is one of the best gifts and learning experiences a child can have.  

Expensive, enlightened private schools know this and many make exposure to nature a core part of their mission. Many local residents cannot afford a private school experience, but If Liberty State Park is preserved as a natural green space, it will be available free to local, regional, and visiting children to have personal, immersive experience with nature.  

For a half century, Camp Liberty has done an outstanding job of giving local children a great experience of recreation in nature.  Tuition is reasonable and there are scholarships for many who need them.  Camp Liberty educators make great use of Liberty State Park's natural environment.   I am sure that many school teachers use the park for educational programs in nature as well.

John Joseph,,"Thank you for the presentation and discussion today (March 2nd) at the Liberty State Park Design Task Force Meeting.  I broadly support the plan as it stands. My comments  :

* I support reducing the space between the sports facilities in the north side next to the Marina. I also like the idea of keeping parking further away and using public transportation / bike shares etc., to bring people to the sites. Any parking lot should emphasize secure bicycle parking and have trees set in a way to shield it from public view. 
* I like the wider natural seating options for the amphitheater. My preference is for the amphitheater to be located on the north side of the cove.  I would prefer not having a clamshell design; rather I would go for something more open and flexible. Also, only free activities should be hosted there.
* I think the amount of space allocated towards active recreational activities in Phase 1B is sufficient. I like that the active facilities are located together instead of scattered across the park. 
* As part of the overall active recreation features, a biking loop should be created along the Audrey Zapp Dr - Freedom Way - Morris Pesin Dr - Philip St for the ""active"" cyclists (think lycra) and to separate them from the other bike paths that would be used for more casual movement.  
* There is very little access to green space in Jersey City and Hudson County. Hence it is important to ensure that green spaces are prioritized in the design of the Park. The high volume of traffic in the park attests to the preference that people have for the current emphasis on passive recreation. 
* Future meetings of the Task Force should be broadcast live online. There is no need of public commentary at these meetings, but there should be transparency regarding its deliberations, especially given the apparent push to make material modifications to the existing plan.",jonvjoe@yahoo.com
Jane Conrad,,"I support the plan to make Liberty State Park a Central Park-style park with FLEXIBLE green spaces.  That is a design that has stood the test of time and served the people well.

Please do NOT use plastic artificial turf in this location.  Artificial turf gets extremely hot, raises flood risk, and contains PFAS and other neurotoxins and endocrine disruptors.  Why should local youth be exposed to these harmful substances?  As well, when this area does flood, all the crumb rubber and loose plastic grass blades are going straight into the estuary.

Instead, please consider setting up a program at Liberty State Park to train local youth in how to manage NATURAL GRASS for lawns and sports fields, how to care for trees, and how to maintain sustainable natural spaces.  Train kids to be stewards of the land, and this can lead to them getting green jobs and protecting ALL of our futures.",jspjnc@aol.com

Eugene Ferrara,,"It is clear that the current plans do not take into consideration the existing and flourishing services of Liberty State Park. Specifically, the marina and the restaurants. it is also very clear that the plan does not have any concept of current or future needs for traffic flow throughout the park and the area of Jersey City that the park borders. The plan should be altered to leave everything alone on the north waterfront area and to enhance the entry roadway by putting in a four-lane roadway where the cobblestones are, and to the south and also enhancing the roadway to the west. By doing so, it will open up the area that is just south of the current cobblestone Audrey's Zapp drive and venues that are being requested such as ball fields, tennis courts etc can be a accommodated in that section. However, again, this is not Jersey City Park. It's Liberty State Park and as such the venue should be for the mass of the state, not for the specific needs of Jersey City. Focus should be on redoing the bulkhead along the north wall of the marina  property.

The Revitalization Program reiterates that Liberty State Park is a public good for all. I strongly oppose any inclusion of privately-owned facilities, specifically those proposed by the People's Park Foundation. Public parks are one of the few third places people can gather and enjoy without any financial expense.

Maureen Crowley,,"The first director of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather, envisioned both national and state parks as a great system containing “the highest potentialities of national pride, national contentment, and national health…A visit inspires love of country; begets contentment; engenders pride of possession; contains the antidote for national restlessness…”  

Liberty State Park speaks to Mather’s vision in many ways.  It’s not just that the site looks out at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, symbolizing core values and immigrant history to all visitors and to our city's diverse population. It’s also that the park to some extent balances the ceaseless building, fueled by the profit-motive, of the city around it, and of the city whose skyline is visible from it. It’s that the park was created and is sustained through grassroots people power. The preservation of Central Railroad terminal is a material reminder that we respect our architecture and our history. 

That history, however, should be recognized not only for its achievements, but for its ills,  starting with the displacement and erasure of indigenous peoples who once used the lands of LSP, and including the environmental degradation left behind by the railroads once their profits declined. The land restoration that has taken place in Liberty State Park gives us hope that we still have a collective ability to address our historical mistakes and injustices and maybe even have a chance to address overwhelming challenges like human-caused climate change.

The DEP has been leading a process to improve the park and balance interests. My own view is “less is more”-- that the park should not be used to satisfy the city’s needs for active recreation. If active recreation to the park, however, is added it should be explicitly acknowledged that it is not a precedent encouraging future incremental increases in active uses and more infrastructure. Instead, the goal for the park should be respect for the open land and water, for habitat and nature education, for providing rare opportunity for our children to be in touch with nature. It should be the primary responsibility of Jersey City and the developers seeking to build in the city to provide for the active recreational needs of our growing population and our children, and to address the needs of communities near LSP whose residents want more recreational opportunities. 
 
The future should not include an exclusionary Sports and Entertainment Complex or any other large-scale commercial uses.   Increased automotive traffic should be discouraged. Any added circulation paths should use permeable surfaces. Park entry should be and remain free. The park should not be viewed as a revenue-producer, but as the People’s Park, open and free to all.

Nicole Greco,,"NJ's DEP, by its own definition, describes itself as an ""unfailing guardian of New Jersey's most precious natural and historic resources.""  

Mr. Fireman wants to turn LSP into the only product he knows how to sell- something for a youth-driven, entertainment-above-all-else, American stereotype. This entire thing reeks of ageism, classism and the outmoded capitalism that drove trees out of places like Jersey City in the first place. 

I ask the DEP to fulfill its duty to protect the state's natural and historic resources at this critical juncture. On the historic side, there's the Morris Canal.  The natural resources are too extensive to list.  Just following the line of thinking that  LSP is one of the most vulnerable salt marshes in the entire Hudson estuary- have environmental groups on the other side of the Hudson (and upriver) been invited to attend/comment/weigh in?  The boundaries of the estuary region include both NJ and NY. If Fireman's vision comes true, and he gets to replace entire swaths of greenspace with impervious surface, how would that not play into regional floodin

LSP was a gift to present and future generations by planners and taxpayers. The park, and subsequent remediations have been bought and paid for by taxpayers with the intent of creating greenspace access for all. It took decades to get the land to reach its environmental potential. Replacing it with concrete and other impervious surface is an enormous step  backward and will only benefit some for a finite period of time. The region is not short on recreational space- with two major arenas within 10 miles and world-class sports facilities available for contract and use at public institutions nearby.

Where is the proof? The need for preserving this space is well documented by not only the NJ DEP, the EPA but even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gets it: their analysis of the Hudson River estuary concludes the following: ""The vulnerability of the entire area continues because of its desirability for development opportunity. Only comprehensive planning that recognizes the habitat values of this area, coupled with analyses of the impact to the habitat of individual proposals taken in the context of cumulative impacts, will result in balanced and effective protection of the estuary.

Where, then, is the scientifically proven, measured, monitored and cross-referenced demand for more recreation in Northeastern New Jersey? Access to all the proposed activities in Fireman's plan already exist, nearby, and are reachable via mass transit. Trading environmental resources for additional entertainment is a poor investment with decreased ROI in the face of climate change. It's bad economics, short-sighted planning and a disturbing example for younger generations. 

Although the plan is presented as a way to benefit today's youth, let's remember this, today's youth are in a mental health crisis. They worry about their future, their world. Pour concrete today, and it will take decades for them to restore LSP to its current glory.

LSP is for the people. This plan is for the age demographic with the most disposable income. One example: amphitheaters and arenas are not welcoming places for elderly or disabled people but the park is. There's no democratization when you replace flat, soft ground with multi-level concrete staircases.

The head of DEP, Shawn LaTourette, pushed back against concerns that the park would be commercialized, as many conservationists have long feared. In a call with reporters on Thursday morning, he said the plans don’t include any large-scale developments, like a large community center, entertainment venue or track and field stadium.

Samuel Pott,,"moved to Jersey City in 2004. Raised my family here. Homeowner. Over 19 years I’ve built Nimbus Dance and Nimbus Arts Center - the largest arts non-profit in Jersey City which serves over 16000 annually including 6 youth each year with ongoing arts.

Investment in and preservation of open green space is one of the single best ways to ensure the long-term health of our community.

There is nothing like parks and open green space to preserve long term value to property, to retain residents, and to maintain the sense of identity and character that we all love about Jersey City. 

What would New York City be without Central Park, Riverside Park? What would Brooklyn be without Prospect Park? If instead of preserving parkland we had built stadiums where our National Parks now stand - Yellowstone, Yosemite, Acadia - in those days the profiteers wanted dams, oil wells, and mines. Gratefully open space was preserved and our nations greatest natural sites will be available for future generations. 

Liberty State Park is no different. This is one of our nation’s most important public spaces. We can’t get this wrong.

Jersey City has experienced rampant development that has not included important investments in green space. 

Should we build opportunities for youth activities? absolutely yes. But more out-of-control, for-profit development of one of Jersey City’s precious few open green spaces?  Definitely not.

Ryan Hussey,,"I use this park nearly every day, enjoying the beautiful trails by myself, with my dog, or with my friends and partner. I have trained for multiple marathons here, and I absolutely love the park as it is now - a free, public space where I can connect with nature in our city. This park is actually a big part of the reason why I chose to live here. Please do not approve this plan. This is not what our community wants.",rhussey62@gmail.com
Reni Stoll,,"LSP is our only natural sanctuary offering refuge and a much needed respite from the busy city life, we use it when we need a break from the noise, construction and litter pollution we face daily. We need to keep it as natural as possible with native vegetation, organic paths, unobstructed vistas. We want Central Park of Jersey City. We want to see the sky, the water, birds, trees. We want to connect with nature.  We don't want to see buildings, stadiums and venues. There are plenty of opportunities in other areas of Jersey City. Fix what we have. Keep the fields in LSP open, green and free. Let's not fall prey to greed, monetization and commercialization. Thank you. Reni",renistoll12@gmail.com
Judith Green,,"I am following the deliberations on LSP for the North Jersey Sierra Group. Our point of view was well expressed by Adam Nolan of the NJ League of Conservation Voters. We strongly endorse the revitalization, clean-up, restoration (e.g., of wetlands), preservation and enhancement of the land, public land, for the use of all. We are opposed to any commercial development of the Park. As we have commented in the past to the DEP, the remaining natural jewel in the region called Cavens Point must be protected from development. We stand with Sam Pessin and the Friends of Liberty State Park.",jugreen547@gmail.com
Joann Brennan McKee,,"A park is a place of refuge, where people can go to experience nature and escape the pressures of daily life. It is not a football stadium, or a major concert venue, or a casino development, or a golf course. It cannot be used to fill the recreational void that is rightly the responsibility of Jersey City. Liberty State Park should be treated, as are other state parks, as primarily a place of respite.

A slowly growing trend in the U.S. is the acquisition and return to nature of golf courses, eliminating their environmental pollution and overuse of water. See the New York Times article of 2/15/24, entitled “After Shutting Down, These Golf Courses Went Wild.” This is an option that NJDEP should consider. Adding the current golf course space to the park would eliminate the pollution generated by the golf course and would provide additional space for active recreation without compromising the intrinsic nature of a state park. It would also eliminate the constant pressure from the golf course owner and his agents to privatize the park.

The NJDEP must not lose sight of its core mission by turning Liberty State Park into a commercial venture. The park is a precious resource and needs to be protected in perpetuity, because once it’s gone, it’s gone.",jmcbmck@aol.com
Becky Hoffman,,"Thank you for  hosting this meeting on 3/2 in person at Liberty State Park and with the opportunity to participate via zoom and this comment box.  Please make sure the process continues to be OPEN and transparent.  Too much has been done behind closed doors that has increased misinformation and animosity when there is more in common than not.  However, the one area where there is extreme disagreement is on any efforts to privatize any part of the park - that cannot happen.  Liberty State Park needs to remain free and open to all.

I am a resident of Jersey City AND the State of New Jersey.  The City of Jersey City is primarily responsible for recreation spaces  and has failed the community in that respect.  That said, there is room for both recreation and open space in LSP. What is Not negotiable is turning over the park to private interests or creating a sports and entertainment complex as endorsed by those supported by Paul Fireman.  

The  vision of this  park as an oasis for our community and those in the state of NJ and that includes the proposed 60 acres of recreational space while protecting and restoring the wetlands is important. Finding the proper balance should be the role of this task force.

The commissioner mentioned hosting large events like fan events for the World Cup. While exceptions for unusual events like this should be allowed with proper permitting - this is NOT the general use of the park for the public on a daily basis.  It should be primarily for the residents of JC and New Jersey who need a respite from the challenges of urban life.

Last, I liked to say that the Task Force should listen to Sam Pesin and Friends of Liberty State Park.  They have been stewards for the park since its inception and have guided it  with vision and passion and making it sure it remains free and open for all.",bhoffman45@comcast.net
Shayna Marchese,,"I support Liberty State Park remaining a free, open green space for the people of New Jersey, and support the current revitalization plan. I do not support any attempts to privatize or commercialize the park.

There's been a lot of discussion about active recreation in the park, specifically referring to adding more active recreation for residents of Bergen-Lafayette. Historically, diverse communities like Bergen-Lafayette have been excluded from nature activities (called the ""Nature Gap""). Pushing the rhetoric that active recreation is more important than passive enjoyment of nature is enforcing the Nature Gap, not working to end it. We should be focusing on making outdoor spaces welcoming to all, and a key part of that is ensuring that we have natural spaces at all that are close enough for people to visit regularly. Some active recreation at LSP is fine but no matter how much is added to the plans, more is pushed for. Passive recreation is also more inclusive to more people, as not everyone can participate in active recreation.",shayna.marchese@gmail.com
David Spence,,"Of the 4 options proposed for the phase 1B athletic hub at the north section, the one with tennis and basketball courts may work best for that area for several reasons:

1. This option does not create high amounts of traffic since their uses have a smaller amount of players and less potential for high amounts of spectators. Traffic at the Audrey Zapp entry point is already very congested.
2. Parking needs for these uses is much simpler to plan, and a better scale  
3. Existing Marina access and parking areas are maintained 
4. This option provides smaller areas of storm water runoff when compared to Astro turf fields 
5. They provide active recreational space for local residents.

Due to the size and width of regulation football/soccer fields/running track, the other options eliminate the marina parking and access to the docks which is not practical or a workable solution. These proposed uses also create high amounts of traffic and congestion for organized games and tournaments, and require a much higher degree of management and maintenance. 

Having said this, eliminating 2-3 BB courts would be a more appropriate ratio of developed vs natural space for this part of the park.

I look forward to seeing the direction of the design.

Thank you",david@windigodesign.com
Julie Daugherty,,I completely support the DEP process for planning the park through community input. I believe the park can be improved and can provide active recreation as well as natural areas but making the park a sports and entertainment center is not what the natural park should be changed to - we have to protect the natural parts of the park. It is hard for me to trust the task force because it was appointed- so I don’t know who they are representing. I would ask that all meetings to be opened to the public- if the public is not there we should have access to the transcript or recordings of the meetings so we all know what is being discussed .,juliedaug@gmail.com

The traffic signals are inadequate. This would be a massive, timely, and costly expenditure of public funds, and I don't believe it would generate revenue long term. Furthermore, where would the attendees park? All of the green space within LSP would be gone before we know it.
Soon enough, it wouldn't be a park at all - ""Liberty State Concrete Lot and Pavilion"" they would name it. Just think of the heat radiating off of it in the sweltering summer months. Wouldn't that be breathtaking!",adam.smieszny+depnj@gmail.com
Robb Kushner,,"My name is Robb Kushner, and my wife and I live at 9 Regent Street in Jersey City. We have been residents for 14 years - and we love it here. In addition, our adult children and their two families, including three young grandkids, also live in Downtown JC. 

Liberty State Park is unparalleled as a masterpiece of our parks and natural areas. Whenever I go to Liberty State Park, I feel a deep sense of freedom, peace, and connection to nature. This is a feeling that never gets old - and never goes away. Exploring the different green spaces, observing the wildlife, relaxing on a bench or in the picnic areas, and walking along the waterfront, away from the noise and bustle of the city - these are treasured experiences that refresh and restore me.

Along with all of the individual activities - being in nature, running, and bicycling - available at Liberty State Park, families and groups can take advantage of the rich offerings of Liberty State Park’s playgrounds and picnic areas. Our grandkids, along with so many others, have celebrated wonderful birthday parties there.

I am encouraged by the development of a multi-stage plan for thoughtful development and enhancement of Liberty State Park. This plan shows that we can include active recreation in the park while keeping it as a wonderful public space.

In place of detailed comments related to the proposed design plans for the park, I want to underscore that I, along with many other local area residents, stand very much AGAINST large-scale commercialization and privatization in Liberty State Park, including stadiums and/or concert venues. 

Projects and facilities of this type have no logical place in the peaceful, natural environment of LSP. If these facilities were proposed for Central Park in Manhattan, there’s no question that these ideas would be summarily rejected. The same should be true for our precious local park. 

In addition, we need to fully protect the Caven Point Natural Area Migratory Bird Habitat and Nesting Area from demolition by Liberty National Golf Club.

Finally, moving forward, any future committees and/or task forces focused on LSP should include long-time community stakeholders currently excluded from its decision making committee, such as the Jersey City Parks Coalition, the Urban League of Hudson County, and statewide conservation organizations.

Beatriz Bofill,,"Liberty State Park is the jewel of New Jersey and this needs to be kept in mind - no large scale commercialization. Phase 1A, Phase 1B, appear to be designed in the spirit of the kind of plan the People want, not so clear in Phase 2.  All phases must insure the design stays a public park for the People.  All parks are democratic spaces where all can come for some peace and tranquility. Liberty State Park should be maintained as a sanctuary where you can relax and decompress, it must stay resoundingly a natural environment in the dense urban area in which it is found.

Please do not sell out to powerful interest who use their financial wealth to buy what is not theirs.  No Commercialization in Liberty State Park, no large Stadiums or Theaters.  It is important to reduce automobile travel to the park.  Encourage and improve public transportation to the park and biking to the park with ample protected bike lanes and bike parking - other micro-mobility devices should also be included in bike planning.",bbofill@yahoo.com
Henry Pullin,,"For decades Liberty State Park has provided people from Jersey City, from New Jersey, and from around the world with the opportunity to connect with nature, connect with the history of our region, and enjoy access to free open space in the middle of one of the most densely populated areas of the world. I believe that it is incredibly important to expand upon and enhance the resources that Liberty State Park currently provides and that the privatization and commercialization of areas of the park, such as the construction of a stadium and other private venues, should NOT occur. Access to free open space and natural areas is very limited in this area. The natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced allowing for more passive and free recreation. The proposed salt water marsh is an excellent example of expanding on and enhancing the open space in the park. Not only will areas like this enable people to connect with and learn about the natural world, they will provide for storm residency and create wildlife habitat. Natural areas should be enhanced and created and existing natural areas should be protected. This includes the Caven Point area, this is a vital natural area that provides habitat and the opportunity for education and passive recreation, it needs to be protected. 

This is not to say that opportunities for public active recreation should not be created. Fields and courts can be created in a concentrated manner in different parts of the park. A great example of a well designed active recreation facilities can be found at the Brooklyn Bridge Park in NYC. Larger fields can possibly be created but should be kept to a minimum. Limiting the uses of areas the park by building large active recreation fields is not fair to people who are looking use the park in a wider variety of ways. 

In summary, the park should be modeled after a Central Park style park, natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced and used as storm water infrastructure, and active recreation should be built but in concentrated areas and not at the expense of natural areas. Additionally, private venues and stadiums should absolutely not be built.

David Burdzy,,"I appreciate the idea of revitalizing Liberty State Park and bringing more opportunities to the community in enjoying their experience. As a born and raised member of Jersey City, I have seen many changes to the city in the past 20 years, which had both positive and negative effects on the community. Seeing these plans, I will say that I do not think adding athletic fields will benefit the park or the community. There are already a handful of city parks full of different sports courts and skateparks surrounding Liberty State Park where kids and teens may play and be active. The purpose of the STATE park is for it to be a conservation of the environment, allowing migratory birds to nest and have their own space. For people to get away from the bustle of the city and to be enveloped in nature. The inclusion of these sports facilities will take that experience away and increase noise pollution that might scare away the birds and other wildlife. It is said that the inclusion of these facilities will bring more people to the park but the park already has many families, runners, and birdwatchers that come causing the parking on the weekends to be full. If facilities are added, more parking space would be needed to be constructed. Remember, this park isn't large enough to include everything this plan wants and to still feel like a state park. Liberty State Park is 1/3rd of Central Park which is why it can include the facilities it has. Jersey City has enough city parks that include facilities which should have revitalizing as well. Add more green space to the city in general. 

I do happen to agree with the inclusion of a community center as long as it's not in any natural wetlands occupied by nature. The facility plans including a community garden and a classroom is important, it helps reach out to the community and our youth to teach about environmentalism and ecology which has a massive influence on our future and the planet's future. I also approve of the Train Shed at the Central Jersey Transit Station to be utilized into a walking space that mixes history and environment, with the inclusion of train cars, more community gardening and even the possibilities of composting or bee gardening. This applies to the amphitheatre space which has a natural design to it. As well as love the idea of art space throughout the park such as the rememberance grove. It would enhance the beauty of the park and allow local artists to reach the community and add a unique personality as well. 

As for the beach, I don't know how I feel about that as a piece of the state park. It doesn't feel right or natural. It clashes with the rest of the design. 

Finally my thoughts on the clean up of the part of the park that is considered the Habitat conservation is important as long as it is an environmental cleanup that is to remove any chemicals and hazards to the wildlife. But I'm not sure if the landscape should be changed physically to include trails if it impedes upon the bird sanctuary and disrupts their habitat. This includes the freshwater wetlands and tidal wetlands if it means bulldozing and creating those spaces, but if they already exist there naturally and left untouched, then it is fine. In the end, the bird sanctuary should be left untouched and far away from human interaction unless it's to the birds benefits, Caven Point included.

Also the fact that some of the task force members come from dubious so-called community groups such as people's park foundation who are new groups funded by Paul Fireman and have their own agenda to move Paul Fireman's agenda forward. 

That these representatives have the opportunity to make their false claims about flooding the park, or that there's nothing to do in the park, in a closed door session is very concerning.

Jyoti Shankar,,"Jersey City urgently needs to prioritize expanding its green spaces and tree cover. With one of the lowest green covers in the nation and losing substantially more trees than we plant each year to concrete development, we're setting ourselves up for increased heat absorption in the summers, making the city less resilient to future warming. Instead of further covering areas with concrete, let's maximize the space for trees, especially in Liberty State Park (LSP). A 2015 study by the Jersey City Environmental Commission found the city loses at least 126 trees annually despite planting efforts. This trend has only worsened, with recent reports indicating a decline in the tree canopy to less than 11%. Please see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI8Fu0VSo_C5puB6UHe5XX9VzhfX8xid/view and https://www.tapinto.net/towns/jersey-city/sections/green/articles/making-sure-trees-count-jersey-city-tree-census-shows-a-decline-in-canopy-cover

Building a stadium would only contribute to more concrete and take away valuable free access to the park, favoring private profits over public benefit. This move doesn't align with the needs of the millions of residents who rely on LSP as one of the few free nature spaces available. It's not a wise use of our natural resources and would harm the already fragile biodiversity of these areas. Let's prioritize long-term sustainability and community well-being over short-term gains.

I would like to emphasize. Jersey City residents would like Liberty State Park with more trees and free access to nature. Please don't shrink our access to nature by building concrete stadiums on land that could be used for trees - increasing the health of the community.",jyoti.shankar@gmail.com

Jessica Zimmer,,"Northern Athletics Hub:
- consider that boating (motor, sail, kayak, jet ski, fishing, etc) is active recreation that already exists, please don’t remove / impinge on facilities that make our current, existing recreation less accessible or feasible

- There’s a reason “soccer moms” have minivans or SUVs.  When I take my family to a park or facility for something as short as a 2 hour soccer game, we bring snacks or meals, coolers of ice and water, shade umbrellas or canopy, folding seating or a ground cover, and a way to toilet my little ones.  Remote parking with a bus system makes my trip that much longer and more difficult to lug all that stuff from the car to the sidelines, and would reduce the number of trips we would make each year.

- necessary facilities for sports participants and spectators include fresh drinking water sources and bathrooms at the very least.  I don’t see these sideline facilities on the NAH plans.  If I’m not lugging outside food on the remote parking transfer bus, then I need to be able to buy these things at the field.  I don’t see snack stands or meal options, in fact you’ve even proposed taking away our favorite hotdog stand by liberty house restaurant. I don’t see bathrooms or water fountains.  Cramming the most fields you can fit into the space doesn’t make those fields usable.

Connections to local transportation are inadequate: 
I’m sorry, but JC just isn’t NYC yet.  Central Park has a huge and well established multimodal network of transportation options with connections at every park entrance.  Our HBLR doesn’t even connect to our PATH at more than two points, and neither of those seamlessly.   Our NJTransit buses are not nearly ubiquitous enough to support everyone who wants to access our parks, and inconvenient for families with young children and the supplies to keep them safe and happy for a day out.  Again, having to change from local buses to the park bus system would add a leg to the trip to bring my family to the park will reduce the number of times I’m able to make that trip each year.

A fitness trail already exists along freedom way with exercise stations, shade, and passes by existing water fountains and restrooms.

Tracy Puza,,"I agree with most of Phase 1B, as long as the development does not block the view east to the Hudson River.
My favorite thing to do in the park is walk or bike along the boardwalk. The best thing about Liberty State Park is that it is wide open and honors passive activities and wildlife. Please don't overdevelop. Also, have adequate parking for the sports recreation areas.

RE Phase 2 Holistic long term master plan:
1. It does not seem Holistic.
2. LSP is a STATE park. It should not have to solve all of Jersey City's poor city planning. It should be enjoyed by people from Jersey City and the surrounding area as well as the whole of NJ.
3. The 50 acre sports hub seems excessive, especially considering there will be sports fields in the Northern end (Phase 1B). Also, what about the fields at Caven point, which is owned by Jersey City. Also, ask yourselves who will be playing on those fields? Everyone will be fighting over playing rights.
4. I agree with Ms. Patel's comment about the bird friendly lighting and following dark skies protocols.
5. We need to see statistics about the ""deficiencies"" discussed in the meeting. Why should a state park have to solve all those JC deficiences?",tracypuzapa@gmail.com
carrow thibault,,"The task force does not appear to have a coherent understanding of what the community needs or how to provide it. The plan is being driven by the desire of private individuals to build sports and concert venues for profit, from which revenues might be distributed to as yet unidentified future public facilities in the park. I am skeptical about how much money would be left for playing fields, tennis courts, skate parks or whatever, after operating costs and return on investment are covered. I agree with the point made that the DEP and task force need to come up with real data on needs of the community. It is important to determine how to pay for them- through grants, bonding, etc.- not through disruptive commercial facilities like a sports or concert arena which will generate too much traffic and the requirement for acres of parking (which will be empty most of the time) that would diminish the park's environment by creating more run-off and pollution.
Separate the two issues: 1. public amenities such as playing fields, areas for passive activities, education; and: 2. ticketed sports and concert venues with their huge negative impact on the park . I am certain the City can find ways to pay for public community recreational facilities through local, state and federal funding sources. The venues will open to only those who can pay and overwhelm the area with cars. Locate the venues near mass transit, Not in a park!!",carrow@cthibaultarchitect.com
Jaime Conheeney,,"I keep hearing ""let's get this done ASAP"" by some task force members as an excuse not to be exhaustive in planning and consulting the public and responding to their needs/concerns. However, I would like to point out that if the DEP valued efficiency, then why go with the ""lowest bidder"" for jobs? LSP's nature center took 9 years to reopen because of the lack of support, and also because the contractors were not skilled and did not care and were not being paid that much. The nature center was supposed to open in 2019 then 2020 and each time they were close, something would break and the team would have to fly out from Minnesota to fix it...It finally opened in 2021. Getting the right people to do the work and paying a better company is worth the investment.",amortalidea@gmail.com
Beth Daugherty,,"Commissioner LaTourette just stressed that State Policy has been changed to allow for an athletic hub to be developed and funded within a state park.  This is unprecedented and should be done correctly, even if it takes multiple years.  It is clear that the athletic fields in phase 1B are a stop gap measure to provide playing fields for JC residents until the more comprehensive Athletic Hub in the southern portion of LSP is complete. 

Please do not destroy the marina, an existing asset used by many NJ and Jersey City residents, in order to provide a short term solution for athletics that is riddled with problems.  Placing athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will make an already congested road unbearable and create an untenable shortage of parking for both current marina tenants and all those who hope to use the new fields.  

The intersection of Audrey Zapp and Philips/Jersey Ave has become very congested since the opening of the Jersey Ave bridge, and is already fairly dangerous for the volume of pedestrian and bike traffic that crosses this intersection to access LSP. Additional traffic volume due to those using the proposed athletic fields, combined with those trying to access the renovated Ferry building and Train Shed, will cause this intersection and Audrey Zapp Drive to come to a standstill.  

With over 500 boats in the marina, emergency vehicles, both fire and medical, need immediate and direct access to all of the docks in the marine.  This requires a wide paved area adjacent to the marina. The current tenant parking lot provides this access. 

Another safety aspect that is not reflected in the design is safety netting to prevent balls from going into the dock areas.  These nets would be a terrible eyesore and a danger to the numerous birds around the marina.

When considering alternative parking options for marina tenants, it is important to understand that marina tenants are typically bringing substantial gear and provisions to their boat which requires a car, not mass transit or shuttles.  Once delivering these items to their boat, they then need a guaranteed place to park - for the day, overnight, or for many nights, depending on how long they will be out on their boat.  

A thorough traffic and parking study should be completed during the summer before athletic fields are considered along Audrey Zapp Drive.  Parking needs to be designed and available before facilities are built which bring more traffic. While there are numerous parking lots throughout LSP and in JC just outside the park - they are often full. 

Another unintended consequence of placing the athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will be undermining the success of the Jersey City New City Kids - summer City Sail program.  Over the years Liberty Yacht Club members, who are primarily tenants of the marina, have funded the City Sail paid intern positions for Jersey City high schoolers, funded new sails for the City Sail sailboat, volunteered to help teach the participants how to sail, and LYC members have taken the City Sail participants out on their own boats to increase the number of youth who can experience boating.  If marina tenant parking is greatly reduced, this will cause LYC to lose members who have been instrumental in supporting the City Sail program, potentially ending the sailing aspect of this unique summer program for Jersey City youth. 

If an Athletic Hub is a priority, please design and build it in a responsible way without decimating existing assets and causing a traffic nightmare for all.  Please do not build formal athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive.",btdaugh@gmail.com
Jason Renker,,"Having listened to the entire public meeting, I was distressed by the feeling that Liberty State Park is seen as vacant land by many people who want to bite pieces off it in order to solve all the problems of Jersey City. What makes Liberty State Park special is the fact that much of it is NOT developed for high-traffic, high-density use. Furthermore, I was disturbed by the idea that sections of the park need to be developed to somehow act as a destination for people attending the 2026 World Cup, a one-time event that does NOT serve the needs of local residents.

Having said that, I am not against the development intended for Phase 1B—that area is a patchwork of development already. As long as the amphitheater is very low profile, low impact, and does not make the space useless for other activities, even that feature would be okay.

As for Phase 2, I oppose Phase 2A in its current incarnation. The Southern Athletics Hub is a massively overbuilt idea that, as I mention above, seems to simply give away park land to solve the problems with Jersey City. It would take a huge bite out of Liberty State Park's undeveloped area and make it a destination for concerts and sporting events. I am trying to think of other parks—Central Park, Golden Gate Park, Prospect Park, etc.—where such a concession would be granted.

NJ Transit doesn’t have the infrastructure to handle such large groups of people and this would congest the LSP light rail stop which is an essential point of transfer for many commuters.  Without Liberty State Park this reduces the public parks in Jersey City suitable for large gatherings to just Lincoln Park which is less accessible to those in Downtown Jersey City and what will remain of Liberty State Park is a stadium that is empty the majority of the year.",dkjones100@gmail.com
Michele Gillies,,"TRASH!  One of my biggest concerns is that all of this development to bring more people, and concessions, into the park will also bring more trash into the park.  The trash is not really being dealt with now.  I participate in cleanups whenever I can at the park, and my friends and I usually do several cleanups a year at Caven Point…including tires.  So you may build beautiful new spaces, but you need a plan to clean/maintain these spaces going forward.",canucksintrees@yahoo.com
Dylan Elias,,"Very concerned for the parking situation for the marina. Seeing the plans for athletics to take over the parking lot, this is going to inconvenience many people
who regularly use the marina for fishing purposes and for living. Also, putting the athletic fields close to the marina is going to generate a large amount of traffic if not done correctly. Fishing and going out of the marina is very important to the fishing community. Taking away the parking will give a bad experience for people wanting to use the marina, ultimately forcing people to go somewhere else. I want to use this marina in the future and for my children. However, if the parking situation is done incorrectly, it is going to inconvenience many people and ultimately drive them out of using this marina. Which is beautiful and an amazing place for the sport of fishing.",Dylanelias94@yahoo.com
Alexis O'Callahan,,"I am an early-career ecologist born and raised in Hudson County. I also worked at Liberty State Park for a year as a naturalist. I understand that public participation is being solicited, but I am shocked by the calls for ""closed door sessions,"" the plans not being reviewed thoroughly before this meeting, there not being time for task force members to review the public feedback, and the ambiguity of the ""LSP Task Force"". I have a number of comments, all calling for more science and transparency in the design process.

1) Who assembled the task force, and how are you ensuring that this task force is representative of Jersey City and Hudson County stakeholders? Giving the public one comment per session while we listen to task force members sucking the air out of the room is amplifying-- not balancing--power imbalances.

2) I appreciate the commissioner's persistence in trying to consult the public/task force for driving the Revitalization Plan in terms of assessing needs. I think there needs to be a more strategic, systematic approach for assessing community needs, though. Just because someone on the task force or of the public has an interest in Jersey City, does not mean they represent the community's interests (who wouldn't have an interest in one of the greatest parks in one of the greatest cities?). I think conducting social science and geographic research would help minimize biases and those taking advantage of their positions of power/influence to make this Plan into something profitable for themselves. Such studies are done by NYC Parks, e.g. their Social Assessment Surveys, where parks staff interview park users, record where they are in the park, some demographic info (residence etc), and inquire about green space meaning and their needs. This allows the natural resource scientists to track park density and use based on features (e.g. how dense ballfields are vs. bike paths). By analyzing existing use and collecting real data from those who USE the park, you are broadening your stakeholder population and getting a more accurate picture (though this needs to be done across the year).

3) I also think there needs to be a greater geographic scope of assessing needs to identify the uses of existing neighborhood parks & ballfields to track where exactly in the city there is the greatest need. Turning LSP into the ""one size fits all"" for active recreation ignores the fact that this is an unlimited resource. Certain teams/orgs/folks will use the active spaces more than others. There needs to be a more concerted collaboration between the youth sports organizations to ensure this space meets the needs of those who need it, rather than one spokesperson claiming that building more ballfields will solve inequities across the city....

4) There needs to be more transparency about the consultants taking our feedback into their designs and transparency in general about why the designers picked what they did & what studies they're conducting to ensure LSP is fit for their designs. 

5) I would like to see hydrological mapping and climate change scenarios research done for the park before revitalizing it to establish baselines and identify vulnerabilities. The freshwater marsh in the back of the Nature Center was inundated by Hurricane Sandy and became a brackish pond-- meaning the restoration was a failure. How will you ensure that the positioning and capacity of the ""nature based solutions"" will be enough to meet our needs in the face of climate change? I hear there is reluctance to accommodate gray design (retention basins) and the response that we have ""so much nature based solutions"" we don't need retention basins, but look at NYC and remember Sandy? What data are we making these judgments from? 

6) Also, I don't see hydrology mentioned at all. When altering the topography and terrain with amphitheatres, etc, how are you sure this will not negatively lead to stormwater runoff or unanticipated flooding of park areas? Are there other green infrastructure elements you are considering? Why not permeable pavement and permeable basketball courts? etc. Make a space multifunctional.

7) I would like to see habitat quality and biodiversity studies informed by projected increases of use, density, and traffic.

8) How are you going to ensure the restoration projects are maintained? So many restoration projects are started, but do not receive funding to ensure they are successful. The park staff is microscopic and underpaid, yet this is the highest revenue-generating park. How are you ensuring the longevity and sustainability of this work from an organizational stand point?",alexisizzle@gmail.com

Ashley Metius,,"It's imperative that the new design of Liberty State Park prioritizes serious coastal tidal wetland creation and restoration, while effectively addressing climate change, enhancing resiliency, and protecting critical habitats in this prime location of Jersey City. Due to decades of urbanization, pollution, and habitat degradation, these wetlands have been severely impacted, jeopardizing their ability to function effectively as natural buffers against climate change and sea-level rise. Moreover, the loss of these wetlands has resulted in the decline of essential wildlife populations and compromised the overall health of our coastal ecosystems. By incorporating citizen science and engaging Jersey City schools, we can transform this future restored habitat into an invaluable outdoor classroom, fostering environmental education and instilling a sense of stewardship among our youth.

This project presents a unique opportunity to showcase smart design principles in a flagship state park, demonstrating how sustainable practices can harmonize with nature while meeting the needs of our community. Implementing third-party sustainable rating systems (i.e., Envision, WEDG, LEED) throughout the design and construction processes will ensure that the highest standards of environmental responsibility are upheld, setting a precedent for future development projects.

Let's seize this moment to create a vibrant, resilient, and sustainable Liberty State Park that not only enriches the lives of residents and visitors but also serves as a beacon of environmental leadership for years to come.",ashleymetius@gmail.com
Caroline Parks,,"I, as well as my friends and neighbors are disappointed and concerned about Paul Fireman and Bob Hurley’s repeated attempts to put a “sports and entertainment complex” and “5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue in the park” as quoted in the Jersey Journal, and the JC Times reported that Hurley now wants to increase active recreation from 60 to 85 acres.

Liberty State Park is one of the reasons I moved to Jersey City. It’s so nice there, very nice to see families picnicking in the grass, walking the length of the park. I can’t imagine how awful a huge ugly sports stadium would blot out the sky, like a huge eyesore. Or the parking mess it would create. 

State parks are parks not sports arenas. It’s beauty lies in its abundance of nature, bird watching is so much fun. I go there to recharge. I go there to relax. I love that migratory birds stop there on their way. I’ve seen red wing blackbirds, herons, egrets, ducks, cardinals, chickadee’s etc… Let’s keep Liberty State Park a safe habitat for them. With all the building going on and loss of green space, keeping Liberty State Park as a natural state park is absolutely necessary. 

Let’s keep our State Park as a state wildlife park, not a sports and entertainment complex. Seriously no one I know or meet wants this to happen.",Guitarcookie15@yahoo.com
Richard McDermott,,Liberty State Park should be an open and free park with plenty of green space. I and many others are completely opposed to the selfish interest of Paul Fireman and his organization to destroy this green space in order to further line his already overflowing pockets. Please reject this man and his continuous delays and sabotage.,rickmcd@gmail.com
Jill Scipione,,"County parks are being filled with sports fields of artificial turf. Please consider not using these for Liberty State Park. As these artificial fields are flammable they spend much of the time locked up and inaccessible. No one can use them informally.There are no pick up games. There is zero use for the general public. This is highly inappropriate for a State park..

More importantly, artificial turf has many unacceptable and known environmental problems. These are a few from several articles on the subject(I apologize as I am not sure how to include the links):

Artificial turf lasts for eight to 10 years, after which it is typically disposed of in a landfill

Artificial turf does not eliminate the need for water; in some cases, it is irrigated with water in order to temporarily bring down high surface temperatures. 

Maintenance can include treatment with antimicrobials, as well as periodic addition of infill to replace the infill that migrates off the field into the environment.On top of the chemical makeup of artificial turf, it is also impermeable (unlike natural grass). It requires harsh chemicals for cleaning sweat, mucus, spit, blood, bird droppings, etc., that remain on the surface.

 A recent article in Architectural Digest notes that artificial turf’s plastic material “traps heat during the day and holds it through the night, meaning runoff water will leave turf hotter than it would natural grass” - which can have negative effects on aquatic ecology. 

In sunny, warm weather, artificial turf can become much hotter than natural grass, raising concerns of heat-related illness and skin burns for athletes playing on the fields.

While natural grass absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, artificial turf does the opposite by releasing CO2, methane, and a variety of chemicals. Chemical analysis of artificial turf conducted at Yale University found 96 chemicals, 20 percent of them probable carcinogens. In addition, artificial turf contains highly toxic PFAS or “forever chemicals” linked to lower childhood immunity, endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to inhalation, ingestion and dermal absorption, as they are lower to the ground and breathe more quickly.

After years of blowback from parents and environmentalists, some companies are now advertising artificial turf made with “natural infill.” But beware of these greenwashing tactics! These so-called “natural/organic” infills are typically made from silica sand coated with acrylic polymers. These pellets can easily break down into hazardous silica dust – a lung hazard recognized by the EPA as a carcinogen. This is also combined with the breaking down of the acrylic polymer coating into plastic dust and micro-debris. Some “natural” infills are made from cork and coconut, which can easily flake and blow away, leaving a dangerously hard playing surface.

On top of that, no matter how “natural” the infill may be, the plastic green blades that act as “grass” remain a serious environmental and health concern.

As the DEP you are obligated to not further pollute our environment, especially  in a park of all things. And we count on you to also ensure anything that encompasses so many acres that is sited in a state park is usable by the public, not just Jersey City and Hudson County schools and organized teams.

Maria Ferrara,,"This is a State Park. There are very few marinas or boating areas in Northern NJ. If you ruin the parking, handicapped users would have hardships, if there is an emergency at the marina how can EMS reach them,? If boaters leave and the marina goes bankrupt NJ loses lease money.

Jim Rife,,"At the risk of stating the obvious, LSP is a floodplain. Much of LSP was underwater during Sandy, and with climate change, the flooding will only get more severe and more frequent. Any plans for LSP need to accept this truth, and make  resilience the priority. Passive recreation is inherently resilient, athletic facilities less so, stadiums, parking lots, etc. are most certainly not.

Erin Gromen,,"I think the current plan goes beyond what it needs to do to accommodate so many interests.   A park in the dense urban environment (and only getting more dense) that is Jersey City should prioritize opportunities to enjoy nature and remediate environmental issues, such as our disappearing tree canopy, flooding issues, and disappearing wildlife habitats. We don't need more impermeable surfaces (buildings and parking lots). Also it's a completely cynical argument to say the local community needs more facilities and to propose a private sports and entertainment complex that charges admission fees and will not program to local interests. (Additionally, recreation facilities are fine but not really the domain of a state park.) Anyone who says the park has 'nothing to do' I feel has never been to a park before. I approve of the concessions and vision of NJDEP's plan and hope it can continue to move forward.",erin.gromen@gmail.com
Tara Levy,,"I oppose the proposed football stadium and commercial concert venue to replace the DEP's plan of nature habitats, open spaces and paths.  I support a Central Park type path with as much opportunity as possible to enjoy nature.",taralevy@aol.com
Shankar Kumar,,"I strongly oppose plans to construct a 5000-seat football stadium and 7000-seat concert venue within Liberty State Park (LSP).  Such development would jeopardize ongoing restoration efforts focused on creating a unique urban nature sanctuary. As the only park of its kind accessible to residents of northern New Jersey counties along the Hudson River, LSP offers a vital connection to the natural world.
These proposed developments would cause devastating harm to the park:
1) Disruption of Wildlife:  Increased traffic and noise pollution would severely impact bird populations, including critical migratory routes, and other resident wildlife.
2) Loss of Public Access:   The influx of traffic and crowds will deter the very residents LSP is meant to serve. Those seeking tranquility and nature immersion will be driven away.
3) Missed Opportunities:  The county has countless alternative locations, such as repurposed warehouses, that would allow these venues to thrive without compromising LSP's ecological integrity.
Preserving LSP means preserving a rare and precious resource for both nature and our community. I urge decision-makers to choose a location that allows for development and safeguards this irreplaceable park.",zumba10sk@gmail.com
JordanAnn Tobias,,"The ""coaches"" and ""recreation representatives"" for the children on the south side of Jersey City must not remember that there is an existing sports complex in the south side already for the kids in that area  - CAVEN POINT.  There has been a sports facility there for decades with room to grow! 
Has no one recommended that an existing sports facility area be enhanced to better fit/suit their needs??  Who are these people really representing?  If they were so interested in the children of this area in Jersey City, why haven't they advocated to have an existing sports complex area build up for their needs?  It's already there, why start from scratch?  
I grew up in Jersey City.  My mother was born and raised here.  Why are you entertaining plans that will destroy this unique and vital open space area just to please a fraction of the population who want to turn Liberty State Park into a giant amusement park?  The city is allowing massive building complexes all over Jersey City.  Why isn't there a requirement to include recreation space in those plans for people who have lived in these neighbor hoods all their lives?  Where is the city and state here?  Why is the burden of all city recreation being dumped in Liberty State Park?

Michelle Berckes,,"I actually thought the presentation sounded pretty harmless but upon looking at the renderings following the meeting, I truly think this is way too much. It was truly shocking HOW MUCH THIS WILL IMPACT THE OVERALL CALM THIS SPECIAL PARK PROVIDES. 

Jersey city is unique in its habitat because of THIS particular park. The park provides a sanctuary away from the high energy of the city. The wildlife and quiet nooks provide an oasis and a place to escape to. I am all for creating spaces for children to play but as a business owner and resident in this city for over 10 years, I truly believe developing THIS PARTICULAR PLAN WILL CREATE STRESS IN OUR ECO SYSTEM AS JERSEY CITY RESIDENTS. 

THE AMOUNT OF SPACE PROPOSED WILL COMPROMISE THE INTEGRITY OF THE PARK. If there was enough natural preserved space left over I would be on board but this will be a complete takeover and will be an eyesore to this beautiful escape.

Diana Kazazis,,"I heard most of the presentation today and lots of good ideas and comments as well. One idea was to knock out something right away which I think is a great idea.  It gives the project momentum and shows the public good faith in kicking things along (and perhaps saving the site from takeover).  I appreciate the consideration of all types of activities, kayaking included.  One concern I have is that convenient parking must be carefully considered and I don't believe I saw that on the designs.  I understand the permeability issues with pavement but that could also work in our favor in covering up some of the required environmental remediation areas. I also thought that being able to provide some revenue stream might be great to support the maintenance of fields, tracks etc. but minimally.

Marc Kornutik,,"Have attended all DEP meetings to date, including online today. Overall I approve of plans set forth by the DEP…   YET vehemently oppose the large sports venues proposed by Mr. Fireman’s “people’s park” contingent.  
That said as a LLM Marina tenant was totally disheartened by the minimal changes proposed in alternatives 1, 2 & 3 and minimal discussion on the marina overall. 
Unfortunately your video cut out for the fourth alternative presentation but a friend was able to send it to me.  Thankfully that returned the parking to the mix, but still cannot understand why, that area of the lawn should be used for SUCH a density of “small ball” sports without addressing public parking, pathways & other facilities nearby. 
The vehicle lot for the marina needs to be reserved for its use and preferably fenced from that lawn area. If current lawn area is to be changed for general public their needs need to be met as well, yet I do not see that in any of the revised proposals.

Randall Morton,,"The Notth End: This is the commercial part of the park and you should explore similar opportunities since the infrastructure for those types of uses are already in place.
Audrey Zapp Drive is one of the highlights of the park with the magnificent procession towards the city and the mesmerizing view.
The Hudson River Walkway, on the edge of the Morris Canal is part of a larger treasured NJ network. Please explore widening this walkway and making it an elegant promenade that also focuses on the city skylines across the waters.
Parking is dynamic (sometimes lots are full, sometimes empty), To best situate parking, assess the needs of all
Park elements, existing and proposed, and have a credible professional perform a Shared Parking Study to determine the best way to reuse some existing Parkin, add new parking, and how much should be remote. 
The concept plans show sports fields shoe-horned in on the north side. What’s missing is all
Of the additional
Land need around those fields to support spectators, athletes in preparation, concessions, safety arrest, and emergency access. When you later in what it takes to not only layout a playing field, but what land is need to support the safe and effective operation of such an ambitious sports center, you will have to conclude that in total, that use doesn’t fit at all in the narrow strip of land on the north side. Option 4, showing courts, for sports like basketball and tennis and pickleball is the only option that looks like it has a realistic chance of fitting.

Shlomit Geisler,,"As a senior I agree that Liberty State Park requires more shade and shelter from the sun.
It is vey difficult to walk there during the summer afternoons.
I suggest planting more trees which could partially solve this issue.

I also think that parking in all areas should be free and accessible to all in the Park.

The Park should retain its' natural beauty and peacefulness as you plan to develop and add recreation and sports space.
There needs to be a balance of  'quiet' space with 'active' space.
We need to  respect and maintain the greatest asset of the park which is  its' sanctuary spirit.

The potential is great for upgrading the park but keep in mind that park space should also be dedicated to honor our need for seeking peace within nature.
My concern is that the park will become very crowded and noisy and we don't want that to happen.

So let's try to think of ways to balance the 'quiet' with the 'more active' space.
Let's keep all the space in the park 'safe'.

The park needs to remain open and lush and full of free recreational areas for the public. The plans in 1A and 1B support this vision and will provide the neighborhood with improvements to our existing space.

Karen Zavian,,"Liberty State Park is a successful space where people come to see, hear, touch, and generally experience all aspects of nature at their leisure.  Any additional athletic and entertainment facilities should only be considered for OUTSIDE LSP limits.  LSP’s purpose has already been defined!  It is the ONLY FREE OPEN AND GREEN SPACE in Jersey City!  It was created for that purpose!  LSP’s precious GREEN OPEN SPACE is its distinction.  It is a gift we have given our citizens and children.  More important than carving up LSP for ball fields, concert venues and other such stadium like facilities, OPEN GREEN SPACE, and the freedoms it engenders, is the most VITAL offering we must continue to maintain!

Peace of mind, growth of spirit, creativity, works produced by human creative skill and imagination, and health….

Moriah Kinberg,,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. A few questions came up for me.

Has a study been done to actually assess the need for recreational space and athletics?  I would suggest actually doing a study to determine the need for athletics before spending billions to implement these fields. There is a football field ""Saint Peter's Prep James F. Keenan, S.J. Field"" next to the park. Was this considered? 

There is another full size football field in Washington Park that was built less than ten years ago and is not well utilized just to name a few. Washington Park is a County park and the football field may not be considered as a field that is available for use by JC students. I would look into this to see if the fields in County parks are accessible to all students in the County. They should be but that needs to be explored. 

We also have an ice skate rink and skating rink in Pershing Field that needs to be repaired. We also have several city parks that are filled with ball parks that are locked and not accessible to the public. 

Additional recommendations: 

1.) Incorporate public transportation into the park and more accessibility. Make the park by design as much as possible less reliant to cars. Pedestrian oriented.

2.) I support the use of all fields that are built out for stormwater management. It is needed and will also assist with addressing stormwater issues. 

3.) Support the nature based amphitheater 

4.) I also support understanding the existing uses of the park and expanding and facilitating the existing. 

5.) Keep as much of the existing plantings and trees and plant more trees and new gardens.  Are there any plans for new plantings, trees, art and nature installations? 

I support the proposed Phase 1 project. Using nature-based solutions to address flooding issues. We need nature based solutions to flooding. This project is a solution to flooding. I am not supportive of the additional athletics with out a study that shows the need based on the number of JC students who play these sports and the existing athletic fields. 

Phase 2

I agree with as much open space and multi-use as possible, especially given that we have several football fields in the City and surrounding areas. 

I do not support locked facilities that privatize the park and limit the use for everyone. 

The needs of the community are not limited to athletics. Jersey City has a recreation department and many opportunities and facilities for sports. This does not mean that there isn't a need but that need can be quantified and decisions should be based on data that includes existing facilities in City and County parks, schools and recreation areas. 

For the Jersey City community that I am a part of, one of the things that we lack is open green spaces. I personally utilize Liberty State Park as a refuge from the built environment that surrounds us. 

There is a massive need for open green space within an extremely built out city. Children in Jersey City need access to nature, open space to play safely, to fly kites, learn how to ride a bike in a space without cars. Areas that are free from development while our city continues to get built out. 

My biggest priority is actually maintaining as much open green space as possible, given the environmental and community benefits. 

I would also suggest making the park more accessible for public transportation and to design the park to be public transit and pedestrian oriented and less car oriented given the environmental benefits of encouraging public transportation. 

There is a lot of talk about bringing additional amenities for the park, like restaurants and food vendors. I would also encourage a study to ensure the economic viability of having additional year-round restaurants. And also suggest a way to encourage people who visit the park to also visit near by areas of Jersey City and for the for the economic benefits to spill over into Jersey City rather than be contained in the park. 

The amphitheater options without bandshell that would obscure the view looks good. Would need to consider accessibility. I would also encourage art installations to go along with the bandshell and other ways to engage with the natural environment. Gardens would be another way to utilize the park and the natural environment.",moriahkinberg@gmail.com

Sasha De Fazio,,"Overall, I'm excited about the revitalization of Liberty State Park. The plans seem like a good mix of passive and active recreation.

I understand some need for athletics, but we should be mindful of what an influx of people will do to the area. We need to be aware of traffic and parking. 

We should continue to focus on nature and ways to incorporate activities into the park that keep it a green space. Canopy improvement is essential. 

Also, driving/walking in the surrounding area is already a disaster. We need to work with Jersey City on traffic violation enforcement and pedestrian safety, especially as this park becomes more of a destination.

Sarah Shanahan,,"I have lived in JC for 7 years. I am a homeowner and a taxpayer with two kids in the public school system. I wish for LSP to remain as natural and undeveloped as possible. This is one of the only opportunities for them to access open space without a significant drive, which is not a reality for most local families. We value the green space, the unobstructed views, the wildlife, the nature trails, and Caven Point. It would be a shame to wipe out such a rare and valued public space with more concrete and noise. I truly believe that is not what those who live and work in this community want.",sarahvanderwerken@gmail.com
Robin Lester,,"The mixed use plans along Audrey Zapp  Drive and the Southern Athletics Hub could be a benefit to the youth of a growing Jersey City. Of equal importance is the protection of Caven Point as wild as it is, and the promotion of a healthy wetland in the Restoration Project Area. Such a wetland would reduce flooding and provide habitat for local and migratory birds. Well maintained trails through the Restoration Project Area would be a resource for nature lovers, bird watchers and school children throughout Hudson County.

OONA JACKSON MOORE,,"The park should be fashioned with Central Park as it's  model with significant passive use along with dedicated uncrowded active use. Reasonable parking close to active use takes into consideration the necessary auto means by which many will use to come and enjoy. Electric charging stations, and bike storage should be considered here as well.
It must also be stated that any active use/community centers in this state park will be available to the larger NJ population as well and not just for Jersey City/Hudson County local residents. Therefore LSP plans should not allow Jersey City municipal government to abdicate responsibility for providing additional active/passive recreational facilities within Jersey City for its residents.",oonajacksonmoore@gmail.com
Anthony Sandkamp,,"50 acres = 37 football fields or other athletic fields (1.3 acres per field) /8 JC high schools= 4.5 per high school
If you create fixed facilities for these fields you negate multipurpose usage. The commission should spend time on summer weekends in the park to observe current usage. The same open field is used for a multitude of purposes if it is left open. When it is built into special purpose it is no longer available for alternate uses. Liberty State park is already the most visited state park in New Jersey. Current uses should be given priority over innovation and local athletic desires. Jersey City athletic fields should be located within walkable distances from each JC neighborhood. There are brown fields in each ward that should be utilized. Open space in this park and its iconic views are the biggest reason it is currently the most visited in the state. Those views and the open space are damaged by creating fixed facilities for athletics.",sandkampww@aol.com

There should be no concert venues, stands or amphitheaters built into the park.  There should never be any idea of putting a casino in thsi park at all.  These types of events/buildings will generate noise polution, create issues with parking, trash and thousands of people coming in disturbing and ruining the neighborhood and the park. This park needs to be accessible to seniors/physically challenged as well as others.  Public transportation needs to be expanded as presently you must walk a long way to get to the park after getting off of the light rail or use a car which many people do not own which has prevented me from visiting the park. This park should remain and needs to be what it is, a park that can be enjoyed by all with benches, picnic areas, passive and active recreation which can be enjoyed by residents and visitors alike but not turned into a commerical venue such as the Meadowlands with all of the issues this brings or privatized for individual or luxury use only..",dm1914@gmail.com

James Barrows,,"The DEP plan is a great mix of active and passive use that provides plenty of local athletic opportunities while fulfilling the promise of open space and greenery this region increasingly needs.

Just as importantly, please de-prioritize auto access and accommodate more efficient transportation into and throughout the park. This land lies in one of the world's most urbanized environments, where the vast majority of people travel by foot or transit.

But most importantly whatever paths you have they have to be designated people walking /motorized bikes. / bikes. They might have to be designed so E BIKES don’t run us over. As it is now it’s not so crowded and wide enough. But please make them wide.  Or separate. Maybe you can make some fields that can be interchangeable. I really liked ideas about the train area having markets and food and the train cars into a restaurant. That would be able to take people back to older days. Just keep the bigger buildings towards back not to get rid of view.  Keep the flat areas that are now the same.  Don’t change the good parts of bbq area. And boat launch is fine as is. Keep it a park. Trees areas. To breath and enjoy air the space. Don’t make buildings. And if you doo keep them green. And low height. With gardens on top. Be creative. I’m not on any task force. But I lived here all my life and love this park.  It’s crazy on July 4th. No one wants that crazy every day.  I really don’t see the necessity for all these ball fields and concert venues. It’s a park. Make it the most beautiful park in the state.   Keep it green. A nature reserve!  Progress doesn’t mean concrete!   Start simple see how it goes.  Thank you.

The space should be used to meet the needs of residents and should have as minimal negative environmental impact as possible. More space for trees, fields, etc. are needed much more than a stadium.

Joseph Albanese,,"Re: Proposed Privatization of Public Lands at Liberty State Park
I am the public access chairperson for both the Berkeley Strip Club (BSC) and the New Jersey Beach Buggy Association (NJBBA). We are two active groups of anglers from all over New Jerey and support the public’s right to access tidal waterways and their shores anywhere in NJ. We wholeheartedly agree with NJDEP when they say, “The Public Trust Doctrine is the principle that certain resources, in this case tidal waters and shorelines, are preserved for public use, and that the government is required to maintain them for the public's reasonable use.” (NJDEP website, Public Trust Doctrine Ensures Access). This right to access tidal waterways and their shores includes the Liberty State Park shoreline at the Hudson River.
Hudson County is the most densely populated county in New Jersey, and the sixth most densely populated county in the US. It has a population density of 15,961 people per square mile (2020 census). That makes Liberty State Park a recreational oasis for residents in the surrounding areas. While not as fully developed as New York’s Central Park, Liberty State Park is just as unique a greenspace. The views in the park include the NJ Turnpike to the west and an industrial park to the south but turn east and you are greeted with unparalleled views of the Hudson River, the New York Skyline, New York Harbor, and the Statue of Liberty. Where else in NJ do you have open public space with as spectacular a view as that?
The boundaries of Liberty State Park are finite and constrained by the development surrounding it. To take any portion of the park and privatize it is a desecration of the park. Public land taken for private use places that land off-limits to park users except for an elite few. That’s not why Liberty State Park was created. It was meant for everyone to enjoy.
Privatization will also block access to the shoreline of the Hudson River. That violates New Jersey’s long-standing commitment to the public trust. Access for the public not only includes visual access, but also requires both perpendicular access to the water’s edge and parallel access along the shoreline. Using that shoreline access allows the public to walk, fish, sit, or simply stand to enjoy the view. Building private marinas or venue space permanently eliminates public access.
Sports fields, passive recreation areas, picnic areas, and improved access for fishing should be what matters. Not privatization through development that would deny the public access.
It is also important to point out that the Hudson River is second only to Chesapeake Bay as a spawning ground for striped bass. Stripers are anadromous, meaning they live their adult life in saltwater but spawn in freshwater including the Hudson River as far north as Troy, NY. As those fish enter and exit the Hudson during the spring and fall runs, they swim along the New Jersey shore of the river and can be caught from the shore or piers extending into the river.
People fish not just for the chance to catch a striped bass, a true pelagic predator, but they catch stripers to feed their families. Any reduced fishing access, literally, takes food off people’s tables. The state needs to increase fishing access at Liberty State Park to better serve the needs of local residents.
Senator Scutari and Assemblyman Coughlin both represent areas with high population densities and highly industrialized areas along the Arthur Kill, portions of Raritan Bay and the Raritan River. Both Raritan Bay and the Raritan River are well known fisheries among anglers. I would think both the Senator and the Assemblyman would look to improve and expand access to tidal waterways in their respective districts instead of looking to take away access at Liberty State Park.

Lorraine Freeney,,"As an environmental advocate and nature lover, I support the DEP’s plans and strongly oppose the alternate plan touted by Bob Hurley. Liberty State a park should not become a massive entertainment complex. Active recreation has its value and is provided for in the DEP plan. But Liberty State Park is vital as a place where people of all ages and all income levels can engage in interactive recreation - walking, birding, nature hikes, picnicking, and more. I have personally led students on bird walks and nature hikes, and seen their interest blossom in ecology and conservation.  Not all young people play team sports. Not all who do play sports would even benefit from a stadium such as the one proposed by Bob Hurley and his ilk. Liberty State Park is vital for the hundreds of bird species (documented on eBird) and other wildlife who live in and travel through the park. But it is also vital for the humans who benefit from it and rely on it for their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

Lucia Marchese,,"Thinking along with a massive botanical garden … think of it as an enchanted pathway where there are separate biking and walking trails … look at the Japanese gardens in San Francisco and the Brooklyn botanical for inspiration… I would make it so that there are little rest stops along the way … a small beer garden, a tea house, an ice cream shop.  There could be a skate ramp area… a few bocce courts… perhaps even a few more of those exercise stops like areas to do various things like pull ups etc.  and then there could be an ampetheater for various acts and music… a small museum … a kids area for discovering nature … a manned nature center.  Sculpture throughout.  However I would steer away from athletic fields that use massive swaths of space and only a small amount of people can use them at any time.

Gregg Lehmberg,,"I’m writing to express my deep concern regarding the plan to develop artificial turf (a.k.a. plastic grass) athletic fields in Liberty State Park rather than using natural grass surfaces. The issues with plastic grass are numerous, despite the natural appearance of the plastic carpet.

Climate Change

Plastic grass is primarily produced from the fossil fuel ethane which is extracted from the earth via fracking. The fracking process itself releases methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pollutes ground water and soil.

Plastic grass contributes to climate change by off-gassing carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in perpetuity once they are produced. Surfaces that are blanketed in plastic grass form heat islands by absorbing radiation from the sun and get as least as hot as asphalt with temperatures often exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

Simultaneously, these plastic surfaces replace a natural grass ecosystem which acts as a carbon sequestration system, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere rather than adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Natural grass surfaces also remain cool during hot weather compared to the blistering hot temperatures of plastic grass surfaces.

Health Implications

The plastic grass blades contain many toxic chemical additives including plasticizers, dyes, heavy metals, and Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). These materials are known and suspected carcinogens, toxins, endocrine disrupting compounds and respiratory irritants.

The infill used to keep the blades of grass propped up is most commonly crumb rubber produced from used tires. The crumb rubber contains an even greater number of toxic substances including volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. The pungent smell coming off these fields on even a mild day is adequate proof that the local environment is being polluted with these toxic gases.

The immune systems of children and adolescents are not fully developed, making them more susceptible to negative health outcomes from exposures to these chemicals. Higher risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion from the excessive temperatures mentioned previously is an additional health concern.
It is well documented that there is an elevated risk of certain non-contact lower body injuries on artificial turf as well. This has been highlighted by several high-profile injuries in professional football in recent years.

Environmental Contamination

Typical fields consist of tens of thousands of pounds of plastic carpet and hundreds of thousands of pounds of infill, usually crumb rubber made from used tires. These materials break down and thousands of pounds migrate into the local environment each year, contaminating soil and water with toxic chemicals and micro plastic pollution. The carpet and infill only last about 10 years and there are currently no recycling facilities to deal with these materials. Inevitably, they end up in landfills or are incinerated. Either destination leads to further climate, environmental, and health impacts.

This is just a sampling of the issues related to plastic grass and would seem to be in direct opposition to the NJDEP’s Green Acres mission of ‘preserving and enhancing NJ’s natural environment’.

Cost of Ownership
There is one final point that I think is highly relevant and that is one of cost. The total cost of ownership for plastic grass is typically two to three times higher than natural grass fields, even when considering the added cost of an athletic field manager and proper organic maintenance.

Natural grass athletic fields designed for sports activity and maintained organically by an experienced athletic field manager can offer safe, durable playing surfaces without the negative aspects of artificial turf highlighted above.  New Jersey cannot afford to sacrifice any more natural space to these toxic plastic fields. The Climate, Health, and Environmental impact are too significant to justify their proliferation.",woodcraftergregg@aol.com

When was the last time they did that and do they want to do that?  If the billionaire developers want these billion dollar projects why don't they spend their billions of dollars buying some land and putting them there.    The public is being divided to misinformation and we should all be working together to make liberty State Park the best that it can be.

The Hudson is polluted enough already. In addition, artificial turf grass is costly and high maintenance. It has to be replaced every 7-8 years. Repeated exposure to salt water may make it deteriorate quicker. Please build these fields more inland, and use real turf grass, not artificial.",laurauhlig@yahoo.com

2. Has the task force considered whether the state funds being spent on Liberty State Park would be better spent on improving and expanding the city and county parks if it is concerned with the activities of the youth of Jersey City and of Hudson County?
3. Has the task force considered the environmental consequences of expanded parking lots and increased traffic to LSP in addition to the noise and other pollution of construction, major landscaping and vehicles in and out of LSP?
4. Do any taskforce members personally take advantage of LSP and personally know how the existing parking lots fill up during the Summer?",lawflash@gmail.com
Joseph Albanese,,"As President of the Hudson River Fishermen’s Assoc it’s important for the public to know that our organization spawned the Riverkeeper movement to clean up the nations rivers and we continue to Fight for the Hudson and public access to this natural resource for fishing and boating. We hope to see opportunities for those activities throughout LSP. A fishing pier or bump out along the walkway so anglers do not interfere with pedestrians. A clean up and enhanced access to the small boat kayak launch and at Caven Point . The HRFA supports FLSP vision for the park.

Mary Miraglia,,"Since the day Liberty State Park opened, it's been a compelling and fascinating destination for people from all over the country and the world.  It's a precious resource to those of us who live in Hudson County, the most densely population location in the United States.
Open space is desperately needed here, and the park is a valuable escape valve for people who are surrounded daily with closely-packed people, traffic, construction and noise, with little relief.  I support the improvements to the unused portions of the park, but it goes without saying that the least construction of intrusive elements including buildings and dedicated sports fields is the ideal.  Please do not make the park another public place that locks out the majority of folks who want to enjoy the open space, broad fields, sky and water that are available here and nowhere else in northern New Jersey.

Roger Heitmann,,I am concerned about stormwater infiltration given the history of flooding during ever more frequent weather events that cause costly damage. Will the commercial entertainment venues (arena & stadium) have stormwater detention tanks and will it be necessary to build a wall to protect the venues as well? What will be the costs to do this and who will be responsible for storm management of the arena and stadium?Also how many acres of natural surfaces be removed in favor of asphalt and concrete surfaces that encourage flooding?,raven242@verizon.net
Arnold Cohen,,I’d like to have the 60 acres of LSP used for free active recreation facilities.  I strongly oppose Fireman's and his surrogates' Sports and Entertainment destruction assault on LSP to include large stadiums.  I support a Central Park type park.,arncoh@msn.com
Susan Schmidler,,"Let's allow the NJDEP to continue and to do the wonderful work they are doing, and what they have planned so carefully thus far. This is a State Park that should be open space for everyone to enjoy. People need to realize this and support it.

Michael Place,,"Are we really still forced to deal with this deeply underhanded propaganda doggedly aiming to get a lavishly funded, commercial development obsessed foot in the door? Paul Fireman is a clownish, shameless caricature of an oligarch who believes his money and power grant him the right to ignore any citizen-led determination for the best near and long term trajectory for this magical urban green resource that doesn't include his own obsessed, selfish vision of hijacking it with his enormous largesse. Allowing this pay-to-play circus and the crude, Orwellian ""discourse"" smearing flood MITIGATION design elements as a flood RISK is an insult to reason, a disgrace and a distraction from the important and challenging process of refining the overall project with community engagement and execution of the project with minimal disruption to the park. He epitomizes a spit shine on what we used to call the Soprano State, and now accept in its money drenched, well dressed, 21st century incarnation of what should be called what it is by all, CORRUPTIONS. It needs to be stopped. 

As for the redesign, much respect to the effort, the process, and with some inevitable misgivings in the fine details,  the core spirit of enhancements without any substantial commercial development.

Melanie Durso,,"LSP is Jersey City's Gem !!! It is a beautiful - serene & peaceful place in an otherwise loud & constantly expanding Jersey City 
The DEP wants to help improve LSP without Destroying the Natural Habitats of Wildlife and of course the beauty of the park itself !
Paul Fireman doesn't care about LSP - 
Paul Fireman just wants to expand his golf course & to do that he has funded (bribed) a group of his Puppets -- two of those puppets - bob hurley & jerry walker are Traitors to the people of Jersey City and to LSP !
IF they cared about this City then they should have given the money that Fireman bribed them with to our Local Parks across the City so they could be improved & expanded !!!
By adding 5k seat football stadium & a 7k Concert venue will only bring more traffic & more Pollution to our City and destroy the area wildlife!
Neither of these Obnoxiously Huge projects belong in LSP --- AND this is absolute PROOF that Paul Fireman just wants to DESTROY LSP !!",mdurso112@gmail.com
Carol Blum,,Save our park! No more golf holes! No stadium! No commercial venues! This is the people’s park! Imagine if someone tried to do this in Central Park. Let’s take Fireman’s golf course by imminent domain.,Carolblum99@gmail.com
Monica Cardoza,,"Liberty State Park’s primary purpose is for open space for unstructured active recreation, passive recreation and nature enjoyment. The DEP pledged 50 acres of active next to the 165 acres of habitats/open space/path, and 10 other acres. 
The Task Force created by Paul Fireman’s law and stacked with his surrogates continues to threaten the park via its commercial interests. Caven Point is an important migratory bird habitat, and should not be used as part of Fireman’s private golf course. 
LSP is owned by the public, for the public.
Gov. Murphy, Senate president Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Coughlin need to uphold the public trust and ensure that LSP remain a place for all people of NJ, not just wealthy folk who enjoy golf.

John Richardson,,"I have been using Liberty State Park in a variety of ways since 1986 when my first son was born & we lived in Hoboken.  We picnicked in the park many times with friends.
Over the years we biked around the park and attended many festivals and events.
In the 80's & 90's I had a corporate special events company in Hoboken and provided sets & decorations for many special events including fund raising rallies for President Bill Clinton.
In the early 2000's I started a high school sailing team at Montclair High School and we practiced on the south side of the park.
Currently I'm involved with sailboat racing every week from April til November.
I love Liberty State Park as it is and do NOT want it commercialized with sports arenas & development.
Thank you.

2. Can well-credentialed park designers be consulted during this process?

I strongly oppose any plans for commercial venues which include building a 5,000 seat football stadium inside Liberty State Park. How does such a stadium protect and conserve the natural beauty of this park?  We need to preserve open spaces which in turn, protects our environment.

Peter Zirnis IV,,"I believe that any type of paid for venue such as a stadium or amphitheater on what is supposed to be public state land is unacceptable.

Alessandra Rafferty,,"Liberty state park is a park. It needs to be a place for wild habitats, playgrounds, outdoor sports and recreation. The task force is an obvious charade. Can we all just acknowledge that? Commercial venues do not belong in a park. It wouldn’t be a park anymore. Tens of thousands of people rely on LSP for fresh air and open space. Commercial venues would add to traffic and worsen the air quality. The vast majority of the people want a natural park in which to play and relax.",ohumanchild@gmail.com
Matthew Trump,,"My name is Matt Trump, I have been a resident of Jersey City for 10 years and have lived in New Jersey my whole life.  I wasn’t a kid who excelled in team sports, but I loved being outside running, hiking, and exploring any green spaces.   I wasn’t gifted academically but my focus and passion for the outdoors pushed me major in Wildlife Ecology in college.  I worked as a wildlife biologist and then spent 10 years working for the Morris County Park Commission managing natural areas and now I manage Park Operations or Bryant Park in Manhattan.  I understand managing public spaces with a wide variety of uses and users.  
I implore the task force to follow DEP guidance on this park plan.  LSP can be so much more connected and integrated into the surrounding communities without becoming dominated by the commercial venue proposals and traffic.  While I understand the need for some athletic fields it’s important to note that these fields would only be used seasonally while trails, bike paths, and the great views of LSP can be enjoyed year-round.  
I think we are selling our community and youth short by pretending that more limited use fields and indoor stadiums will somehow serve them better.  Many residents already treasure LSP and the DEP’s proposal and more programming will only enhance that while also brining new people to this really special urban park.",mptrump@gmail.com
Dana Patton,,"I have lived near the park for 20 years. We use the park daily. I am very concerned with the continued push to try to get privatized ventures into the park. Our area needs greenspace desperately. We have a turnpike running right by us that is planning to expand. Our neighborhood can flood and the park helps mitigate that. I love the plans to expand the parts of the park that are currently not accessible to the public. I love active recreation where there are currently parking lots in between marina and restaurants. I love walkways over marsh and other natural land. I love ideas to get people into all parts of the park that are not parking, such as trolleys, shuttles, bicycle parting. 
No other parks are expected to turn a profit or give up space to private ventures, and I don't know why that keeps being pushed in our state park.",danampatton@gmail.com
Judith Weis,,"The park should be used for active and passive recreation, fields for pick-up sports (baseball, tennis etc.), enjoying nature, open space, bird and wildlife watching, waterfront recreation and so forth.
