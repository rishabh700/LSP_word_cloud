To whom it may concern, 

My name is Bruce Franco. I am a Bayonne resident, born and raised in Jersey City and a retiree from the Jersey City Municipal Utilities Authority. I am proud of the work I did at the JCMUA to protect our local waterways. 

Like many visitors to the park, I am an avid fisherman and fish these waters from both land and on my boat for over 50 years. I have major concerns regarding our environment and the proposed remediation that I would like to share with you that I didn’t have the opportunity to do so despite being in attendance last Saturday. 

Protecting the waterways and ecosystem: 

This plan calls for the flooding of the interior of the park after remediation. However, this area is low-lying and prone to flooding. How do we ensure that the chromium cleanup is adequate?

Failure to ensure complete contaminate removal in combination with storm surges would impact the ecosystem and disrupt the migration paths of all the fish here such as Stripe bass, Porgy, American eel, Winter founder, Summer fluke, Blackfish, Oyster Crushers, and believe it or not, Spanish Mackerel. 

Capping as a pertains to future contamination of water from erosion:

Are there any erosion reports, studies or monitoring plans to ensure that capping and then flooding won’t affect the New York New Jersey waterways, wildlife and people's health. While climate is forever changing and continuously impacting our area, producing storms and surges, we have never seen before, are there any projected erosion reports for the next 5, 10, 20 years from now? Without conclusive proof, the DEP maybe creating a wetland environment that is a contaminated timebomb which will endanger wildlife, plant species, fish and people. 

Essentially your plan, if I understand it correctly, is opening a water entrance from the Hudson Bay into LSP. Is there any discussion with the state of New York about these full remediation plans specifically on how flooding over partially remediated capped land turned into wetlands might cause toxic fill to affect the combined New York New Jersey waterways?

Why do we need to lose the land at all:

This is contaminated land and historic fill that we do not have access to. We are not capping and building up on this land? Are there any reports or findings that show we cannot cap and build up? I just would like an honest answer to this question. Is it a cheaper alternative to flood the area rather than build it up? If so, is it possible to seek private investment to offset some of the expenses? 

Thank you for your time and consideration. I really hope someone can answer my questions and consider the potential impact to our environment.

Respectfully

Dear NJDEP task force,

My name is Christopher Franco, and I'm a resident of Bayonne. As someone who was born and raised here and makes a modest middle-class income, I know how important good parks were for my brothers and I growing up and now my niece. Sadly, under this proposed plan, recreation is more like an afterthought, if at all. 

I have followed the plans to revitalize LSP and NJDEP plan just doesn't cut it for me. Sure, cleaning up the park is important, but that's just the first step. We need a park with things for our kids to do – places to play basketball, run around, and maybe even learn to swim or kayak! The People's Park plan includes all that and more, with a community center, sports fields, and even a pool.

It's not just the recreation plans themselves but rather the location and ensuring everyone can easily access them through the park. This is also why I was really excited to see the People's Park proposal take this into account.

Right now, too many kids in Jersey City and Bayonne, especially in our neighborhoods, have to play on crowded streets or rundown courts. The People's Park plan would give them a safe and healthy place to be active, which is so important for their development. It would also be a great place for families to spend time together, without having to travel far or spend a lot of money.

I know some folks might be worried about the cost, but I believe this investment will pay off in the long run. Healthy kids become healthy adults, and a vibrant park can bring our community together.

The People's Park plan is the clear choice for middle-class families. I really hope you consider some of their inclusionary ideas for recreation and entertainment. Please, let's give my niece and others the chance to play and grow in a park they deserve.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

,Peter,,Franco,,FrancoforBayonne@gmail.com,"Subject: Disappointed in Limited Public Participation at Liberty State Park Meeting

Dear NJDEP Commissioners,

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the public participation opportunities at the Liberty State Park meeting held last Saturday. For an issue of this magnitude, I was shocked to see such a small room chosen which left more than 100 people outside. I felt the police were rude and did not allow people in the room even after seats became available. While I appreciate the opportunity to stay informed about the park's future, it was disheartening to see that not everyone who attended was able to directly voice their opinions during the meeting. 

A public forum like this is crucial for residents to engage in open dialogue and share their thoughts on a project that will significantly impact our community. Especially with media attention present, limiting public participation restricts the ability for residents to directly express their views to both the decision-makers and the broader public.

Public comments delivered directly at the meeting hold a certain weight that cannot be replicated through individual emails.  The ability to voice concerns and suggestions in front of the decision-makers and alongside other residents fosters a more transparent and accountable process.

I urge the NJDEP to reconsider its approach to public participation in future meetings. A more inclusive format, allowing for extended comment periods or designated Q&A sessions, would ensure that all voices are heard and considered.

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter.

Sincerely,

Peter Franco

,F. Elizabeth,,Bodman,,ejbodman@gmail.com,"I am most strongly opposed to any use of the land in Liberty State Park which decreases free access for the public.  Any private use that reduces the open space in the park while profiting a private company is exactly what this land should NOT be used for.  Additionally, with the concern of flooding in the area only increasing, any use that reduces the ability of that land to absorb/mitigate water flow is foolish and short sited. Any such proposal clearly runs in opposition to the desires of the immediate residents of the area as well as NJ residents farther afield who count on this free, open space for leisure activities.",3/12/2024 13:06,10.1.2.6

,Anita,,Perala,,anita.perala@hey.com,"I am writing to express my support for the DEP's plans for the revitalization of Liberty State Park. As a frequent park user and Jersey City resident, I hope the plans will continue to prioritize flood mitigation in order to protect our environment, wildlife, and the adjacent Jersey City communities. Frankly, I was disgusted to learn about the brazen misinformation spread by Mr. Hurley and others regarding wetlands in the park proposals.

I am strongly opposed to privatization of of the park and to proposals for large-scale stadiums or other commercial venues such as those backed by Mr. Fireman and his group, who seem to want to turn a public space into a private profit center.

Regarding the specific proposals for Phase 1B as presented in the image gallery, I have a few comments. I think I said this in previous feedback, but the scenic train depicted in the ""transportation"" and ""circulation"" images seems gimmicky and impractical compared to a (hopefully electric) park shuttle bus. If a park shuttle bus is included, I hope that it will include a stop at the LSP light rail station to facilitate entry into the park and encourage more people to leave their cars at home and use public transportation.

Regarding the lawn to the east of Liberty Science Center, in the Phase 1B concept image, it is labeled as a ""science lawn,"" while in the Commissioner's announcement video, it is labeled as ""playground or dog park proposed."" That space is currently used as an informal dog run by Jersey City residents, being somewhat enclosed and easy to reach on foot from both the Communipaw neighborhood and downtown coming over the Jersey Avenue bridge. I hope the plans find a way to incorporate a spacious dog run in that general area so that dog owners still have a place to bring their dogs to play safely.

In general, I think the Holistic Long-Term Master Plan does an admirable job of addressing the community's need for multiple kinds of active recreation while still providing space for people to relax and simply enjoy the views and waterfront. I hope the task force will not forget the importance of the coastal wetland habitat and fostering an environment that welcomes both local and migratory wildlife. I frequently walk and run in LSP,  and although I haven't gotten there early enough to see the seals, I have seen many birds including herons, ducks, and hawks.

,Aidan,,OReilly,,oreilly_aidan@hotmail.com,"So let's see what's happened here. Environmentalists moved the project that became Liberty State Park from a man made disaster to a park that can not only be enjoyed by the people of our nation, but has also contributed to environmental protection of the entire area. That work is not yet completed as witnessed by much of the area being closed due to one form of poisoning or another. Politicians are less concerned with remediating the problems than they are with generating cash flow for developers and political campaigns. Let's, for a minute, give the politicians the benefit of the doubt and say that their intentions are to improve the area, just for a minute now. The type of ""improvements"" they are pushing for are for a small segment of the population, as usual. Perhaps they have too much time on their hands to think that many people have the same amount of time and money as they do so that they can run down to play a round any time of day.

I definitely DO NOT want ""multi-purpose athletic fields"" in the Northern recreational areas and still only care for a modest bandshell for the park and not a roaring concert venue.  The park needs better public transportation to get to and not projects that will congest LSP with motorized vehicles that take up ample parking space for the same experience they can get going to MetLife.  Any and all parking for LSP should be solely for folks enjoying the natural and communal aspects of the park and not commercial franchise you can get literally anywhere else.

Since time was short, I would like to make clear that while I stand behind the need of active recreation, the land part that was chosen is not ideal. It would be better to have it near Liberty Science Center and the intersection near the Lightrail(s) and the footbridge. 
This would have the added benefit that it would connect better to the proposed active recreation near the harbor. 
This would also give the people who come on foot, by bike or Lightrail better access. 
Looking at the map, I understand that you might want to connect with the wetlands on the other side of the street (how I am not sure) ?

I run, cycle and walk to the park at least 5 times a week and I love how open and natural it feels. I regularly run or cycle along the water front, in the interior and visit both playgrounds with my son frequently. The views are amazing and the facilities are pretty good. I recognize the need to additional sports facilities but I think the size and scale needs to be carefully considered. It absolutely does not need facilities with large scale seating and a stadium. I would think indoor and outdoor, multi-use surfaces would be the most important thing. 

I am lucky enough to live close to the park so I don't need to drive to visit but I think you need to do everything you can to encourage public transport, cycling and walking. I live on jersey Avenue and the area cannot handle more car traffic. Please think carefully about how you can discourage car use, could you establish park and ride systems with satellite lots outside of the park. Another down side of cars is the amount of space you would need for parking that could be left for open fields and open space. Please incentivize public transport.

But don't take away parking.

Please keep Liberty State Park green and free from private development!",3/11/2024 17:43,10.1.2.6
,Nicole,,Keiser,,nckeiser@outllook.com,"To whom it may concern,

First, I’d like to say that Liberty State Park is one of the best amenities in Jersey City. Our public green spaces serve as free accessible havens that we should not take for granted. I know LSP has been a comfort to me - even before I lived in Jersey City (Journal Square!), I would drive to this park. 

Since public comment is open about what we’d like to see in our parks, I like to advocate for keeping our park mainly intact in a non-damaging way. What is proposed in Phases 1A, 1B and 2 are fantastic. I believe in utilizing the land that is there to add on simple amenities like playgrounds, amphitheaters and small recreational areas is fantastic. There is so much benefit for the local community as well as the area at large.

My main concern, that many constituents have brought up and continue to bring up, is a certain individuals attempt to lobby and develop on this land. Their latest proposed plan is to build a large-scale concert venue and sports arena. As someone who works at a mid-size concert venue (over 3,000+ capacity) in NYC, working with large promoters like Live Nation, Bowery Presents and AEG, I know that this would be a foolish mistake. There is data that supports that the music industry is still suffering post-COVID. The radius clause between Newark’s Prudential Center, the MetLife Stadium, and many NYC venues would cause a lot of conflict and competition and just cause further divestment in the market. Ultimately, there is very little profit to be made and would just be reckless construction on this land.

As for the sports arena, again, there is an issue with the proximity to the MetLife Stadium, Red Bull Arena, Prudential Center and more. What teams would we even get to come here?  
Beyond that, both ideas do not consider infrastructure. Our traffic and public transit systems are already taxed. As a state, we are not prepared for the chaos that will be the World Cup at MetLife. Most of the park requires people to either walk, drive or take the light rail (which has its own issues). While the current plan that I support would increase activity in the park, it accounts for making access improvements but would also not match the caliber of a 3K or 5K+ event.

What is also great about the current plan with it's three phases is that many of these improvements don't destroy the park. Construction will occur, but ultimately, very little and utilize the open space provided to create something for the COMMUNITY. Developers do not care about the community. Jersey City struggles enough with development and issues of gentrification. This park is a FREE communal space and what is proposed in this program would make this a more active, beloved space for the community. 

I’d like to thank you for taking the time and consideration and I will continue to support and advocate for the gem known as LSP.

,Cody,,Zimmer,,zimmerlcc@gmail.com,"I am concerned about losing the parking access in front of the docks at the marina. Some of my favorite memories as a child were walking outside of docks and admiring all of the beautiful boats. It would be a shame to see the best marina on the New Jersey side of the lower Hudson fall into disuse because of lack of access.

That might sound dramatic, but easy vehicle access is essential for a marina. We have to bring in sails, haul out garbage, and bring large and heavy equipment to the boats. I don't mind sharing the space in front of the docks and I like that the park is getting some attention and upgrades, but I would hate to see an already existing use of the park get hamstrung so badly, to the point where many people who already use the docks wouldn't be able to use it any more. Leaving the half of the parking spots that are closest to the water is the minimum we would need for the marina.

The proposed alternative uses for the lawn that includes the basketball courts and tennis courts seems like a great solution and better use of the space that would also keep the marina use intact. That would have the benefit of easy trash removal for the marina and the people using the courts. It would also keep easy access for emergency vehicles for medical and fire emergencies at the docks or the courts. Furthermore, it would keep access for disabled people to the marina docks. I know there are currently many people who would have a very difficult or impossible time getting to their boat without such close access through the parking lot being right in front of the docks. It would also keep the larger fields from feeling like they were just jammed into the first available space that would barely contain them.

As for physical quality of the lawn itself for grass ball fields it would be a poor choice for the following reasons. There is significant wind, most commonly coming from the south, because there is nothing stopping the wind from coming in off the mouth of the Hudson. As I type this we are experien in 45 mph gusts with constant wind speeds of 30mph and strong winds are a very common occurrence during all seasons in this location. There is also the concern that soccerballs and footballs would easily go into the canal or hit a boat, and let's not forget that there is commonly an unpleasant smell coming from the canal as well, particularly in the days following a storm that has overwhelmed Jersey City's combined sewer/drainage system.

The fields are also used by many geese, who would leave a lot of goose droppings on any grass field that was constructed there or any turf field that had grass nearby. The ground is also frequently muddy and would need significant upkeep to keep in a usable condition. There are also frequently deer in the lawn, particularly since the clearing from Stage 1 took place. It would not be at all impressive to visitors during the world cup to see how messy any large ball fields located in that spot would be. 

Liberty Landing Marina is the best and largest marina in the area, and it is really the only option for middle class boat owners in this area. It is one of the only marinas on the New Jersey side of the Hudson that doesn't require constant and destructive dredging to keep it viable. It would be a shame to see the last, widely inclusive marina in the area fall into disuse because of hasty planning that removes necessary parking. Please consider these long-term effects and the unsuitableness of this location for grass ball fields when moving forward with the modifications to the Stage 1b planning. I would love to be continue being a part of this wonderful community and to see the marina continue to flourish and add to the vibrancy of Liberty State Park.",3/11/2024 16:07,10.1.2.9

,Paul,,Furfari,,paul.furfari@gmail.com,"I fully agree with the current, proposed DEP plan for Liberty State Park that balances athletic facilities in the Phase1B Northern Area Recreation with an interior of the park that does NOT include commercial enterprises primarily sports stadiums or concert venues.

New Jersey, and particularly Jersey City youth need more green space and athletic fields, and the proposed track/football field, soccer field and baseball field in Phase 1B plan provide the proper amount of fields and provide the rest of the community with access to walking and running trails. Liberty State Park needs balance in its recreation and the development of new fields will increase access without overwhelming the park, or converting it entirely into a series of sports fields that will only be used by limited people. Open space supports flexible use for more state residents and provides the necessary balance to the current 1B plan. 

As a state resident, I am vehemently opposed to giving the park away for commercialization - most prominently stadiums and concert venues that do not support the community and lead to increased traffic. I support improvements to the park in the Phase 2B Holistic Long-Term Master Plan, including building sports facilities along the external facing and Morris Pesin Drive. There is tremendous opportunity to build that facility with access to the highway, which supports state resident use without the burden of increased traffic inside the park.

,Tom,,Paciorkowski,,kayak@blueham.com,"The facilities that are built in Liberty State Park should give people a reason to travel miles to come to the park. It makes no sense to duplicate basic park facilities found at all parks across the city. Why would a kid get on a bus and travel many miles to Liberty State Park just to play basketball when he or she can walk a few blocks to a local park near their home? What makes Liberty State Park so spectacular is the things you can't do everywhere else. For example, in the summer, many families travel to Liberty State Park for grilling and picnics because you can't do that at other parks in Jersey City. I dare you to try and find an empty parking spot in Lot 7 when the weather is above 60 degrees. Where else can you go kayaking in Jersey City? And while I can ride my bike in circles at Lincoln Park, I can ride for miles in Liberty State Park without ever trans-versing the same pathway and without worrying about being hit by a car in a city street bike lane. The focus should be on keeping Liberty State Park unique and special.

Second, large sports fields such as baseball fields, football fields, soccer fields, etc. should be available for general public use without permits when organized sporting events are not being played. It would be a travesty to fence off large portions of Liberty State Park for football, baseball, and soccer fields and have those fields closed to the general public. Whenever I'm in Lincoln Park, all those fields are fenced off and locked, and nobody is using them. Why?

Third, there should be a cost/benefit analysis for every proposal. The benefit should focus on the number of people the proposal will serve. For example, it doesn't make sense to spend millions to built something that only 100 people will use. The cost/benefit analysis should focus on the cost per person. And the cost should include not only initial construction, but the cost to maintain.

Fourth, please don't put down artificial turf. I can't help but think of that song that goes, ""they paved paradise and put up a parking lot."" It would be a desecration to tear up the park's large grass fields and pave them over with artificial turf.

,Irena,,Rothaug,,i.rothaug@gmail.com,"The first and most important thing when it comes to Liberty State Park is to be mindful of preserving it as an open space that is free and available to the public, and for environmental purposes. As downtown Jersey City is a flood plain, the park provides a vital buffer and sink for rain water and high tides. It provides vital green open spaces for a burgeoning and ever-growing city increasingly hemmed in by high-rise buildings. It is also a vital stopping place and nesting area for wildlife, and a spacious place where the city-bound residents can directly experience the beauty of the natural world they would otherwise be cut off from..

The ideal, then, is to maintain spaces where rainwater and floodwater can be absorbed. Any nonpermeable surfaces like parking lots, skate parks, playgrounds, or paved ball courts should be minimized or designed to minimize the impact of runoff and flooding. There should not be a football stadium, concert venue, or golf course on this vital public land-- it would not only cause additional flooding and destruction of the park, but also cut off free access to the park by the public. Any facilities would need to be carefully designed with plenteous and well-serviced garbage and recycling bins, as the estuary and harbor would end up further polluted by plastic bottles, escaped balls, and other refuse from attendees.

A farmer's market in the train sheds is unfortunately doomed to failure, since it would be located far from anyone's actual living space. Visiting and transporting groceries back to the surrounding city would require a car, which many residents don't have. Craft markets or occasional events such as the art festival would have a better chance of success, but don't require such a large space. A better use of the space would be a landscaped park or the community gardens mentioned in the plan-- that would also open up the area as a breathable space to sink rainwater.

Any facilities created in the park need to be in response to actual demand. Will these facilities actually get used if they are built? Will people use a track-and-field venue that's so far away from schools and other training facilities? Will skateboarders come to a skate park they have to take a bus to reach? These ideas simply aren't practical. These facilities make much more sense embedded in a community, not located far away from those who would use them. They should not be built in the park.

Due to environmental contamination the interior of the park has been fenced off for a long time, which has given local wildlife a place to thrive. This has also created a vital and irreplaceable natural wilderness, a green space filled with the trees, marsh grasses, and vital features so many city residents long to experience. Recreating the place as a walking area with trails and information has the potential to create a treasure for Jersey City and the state of New Jersey akin to the beauty of Central Park in New York.

,Julie,,MacArthur,,macarthur.julie1@gmail.com,"As a member of this community, I love having Liberty State Park in my backyard. With so much new development (high rises, parking structures, etc.) we are seeing a loss of community for corporate gain. However, the Revitalization Plan for LSP looks to be a way to regain some of what we've lost. While I would prefer to see these developments on a smaller scale scattered throughout the various neighborhoods of the City, communal amenities are what we all need and hopefully this revitalization will provide. For example, Hamilton Park has the only two tennis courts  to serve the entirety of downtown Jersey City - this simply does not adequately serve our City's residents and I hope you keep that in mind as this revitalization progresses. 

Overall, I appreciate that Phase 1B utilizes an area of the park that is closest to the residential part of the City that is currently being underutilized for parking. However, my greatest concern is limiting public access to these facilities (and the park overall) to prioritize profits over residents. We deserve open space without cost - this is our home and public access to spaces like this keep communities healthy. If this revitalization moves forward it should only be with FREE ACTIVE RECREATION. 

I'd also like to state there should be NO COMMERCIAL CONCERT VENUE brought into LSP - This is a community area that will only see the negative effects of this, including increased traffic, noise/vibration issues, limiting access to their own local resources.",3/11/2024 14:20,10.1.2.4

It is the closest thing we have to pure nature and it benefits our lives in countless ways. We would truly hate to see any sort of building or development take place that would vastly reduce the amount of green space in the park. The only enhancements that should be considered are ones that bring more people to the park for fun and play and to enjoy the beauty of nature. We need to protect the natural space at all costs.

,Tom,,Merolla,,tmerolla@verizon.net,"I watched the March Task Force / DEP meeting via the recording posted on your website / YouTube.  First of all thank you for the work you are doing and your effort to make these meetings open to all.  I live in Central NJ but have visited LSP many times and really enjoy the waterfront walk and the Caven Point Beach section when it is open to the public.  I want to echo most of the comments made by the Public.  It's an insult that a number of Task Force members, including Bob Hurley, decided to leave before the public comments.  And I agree with the public speakers that anyone receiving money to be on the task force should be either forced to resign or have the source of the money they receive be made available to the public.

LSP is a State Park.  I think the efforts being made to provide active recreation makes since in the 60 acres identified for this purpose.  I am less enthusiastic about using the grounds adjacent to the marina for this purpose.  Making the park more accessible to the local residents using a combination of walking and biking paths makes sense.  Adding a trolley/shuttle from the existing Light Rail stations makes sense (electrified please).  What should never be added to a public state park are the items being pushed by the Fireman team.  No large sports or music arenas.  No commercial facilities closed to the general public.

And please, make it clear as soon as possible what are the plans for the Caven Point Beach area in Phase 2.  In my mind the area is already a wonderful spot for nature and people who seek out this resource.  I don't think it needs much else.  I understand why it's closed part of the year for bird nesting.  That's fine.  They deserve a place in the park as well.

Again, thanks for what you do and please make sure all future meetings are open to the public.

,Lauren,,Squillante,,lsquillante@gmail.com,"I am concerned with the inherent bias of the Liberty State Park Design Task Force when it comes to the discussion of active recreation, arts, and culture for the interior of the park. Two of the members of the task force, Elnardo Webster, Jr. and Bob Hurley, are on the payroll of Mr. Paul Fireman, who has been attempting to turn Liberty State Park into his own sports development complex for decades. In fact, in the report of the March 2023 meeting, section 5, subsection g, it says, ""During the course of the 2021-2022 LSP-D Task Force discussions, some task force members independently pursued an evaluation of parkwide opportunities for indoor and outdoor recreational development and other features. While this evaluation was conducted outside the auspices of the LSP-D Task Force, the members who privately sponsored the evaluation shared the resulting concepts with the LSP-D Task force members and presented concepts at LSP-D Task force meetings and elsewhere."" Why are members of the task force ""independently pursuing"" evaluations of any kind without the consent of the majority of the task force or the DEP? It's unsurprising that the concepts that were shared with the task force following the ""independent evaluation"" were ""a community center swimming natatorium, four (4) full size basketball courts, two (2) 2,000 seat NHL size hockey rinks, an indoor track, health center, concessions and/or restaurants, and community space; an enhanced waterfront area with kayak launch, community gardens and greenhouses, extensive walkways to explore the park, 7,000 seat open concert and event venue, 5,000 seat open, lighted football/soccer/multi-use complex with fields and stands for spectators, Olympic level open space 400 m 8 lane track and field facility, and a three (3) season open community activity center for use for farmer’s markets, craft fairs and for flex space."" 

I'm not opposed to basketball courts, a community pool, community gardens, walkways, or multipurpose sports fields with stands for spectators. However, why would Olympic size or NHL size stadiums and facilities be necessary in a community park? Is New Jersey planning on hosting the Olympics in Liberty State Park? That's not what the park is for! The park is for public use by the people of the community and for visitors from across the state and nation. Commercial sports and concert venues have no place in a public park. The noise, the traffic, and the exclusivity those venues would produce would be a major detriment to ""the people's park."" It would make the area off limits to those without the connections or economic resources to access the facilities and would certainly mean the end of a ""Liberty State for all.""

I strongly support the DEP's original plan with the inclusion of multipurpose sports fields and playgrounds in the Northern Recreation area. I have stated before that I am not a fan of turning the historic railroad terminal into a glorified art modern art exhibit. I would much prefer if the area was to be conserved and preserved as a historical site and included educational, historical interpretative exhibits. However, as long as the train shed and terminal remain free an dopen to the public, what is done there won't be at odds with the free and public nature of a state park. This is in constrast to the possibility of commercial sports and entertainment development in the park. Again, that is not what a state park is for! 

I commend the DEP for their efforts to preserve the park's environmental integrity and truly hope they will stick strongly to their original plans for free, public active recreation space for the community and extensive rehabilitated green space in the park's interior for the wider community of flora and fauna, which also deserve use of the park along with the people.

,Rosana,,Pedra Nobre,,rtdasilva88@gmail.com,"As a passionate advocate for environmental stewardship and community well-being, I believe this initiative holds immense promise for our beloved urban oasis that Liberty State Park is. The enhanced ecosystem restoration plan is particularly exciting and critical for the region. By reintroducing tidal marshes, wetlands, meadows, and urban forests, we would not only create breathtaking panoramic hilltops and sweeping harbor/skyline views but also build resilience to flooding and climate change. The flood resiliency design aligns perfectly with the state's commitment to safeguarding New Jerseyans, in this case Liberty State Park, against the increasing threats posed by extreme weather events. The addition of saltmarsh and the enhancement of upland maritime habitats will not only protect against flooding but also foster biodiversity and ecological balance in a nationally recognized estuary of critical importance. And let’s not forget the miles of interconnected paths—more than mere trails, they are pathways to community engagement.

,Lynn,,Mullins,,troubledreply@hotmail.com,"I have been utilizing the open space at Liberty State park for many years, except when there are firework displays. Who wants to wait in that horrendous traffic?  Building one or two huge stadiums that would be used for concerts would create the exact same traffic nightmare.  Not just for people who live quite close to the park, it would affect people driving towards Hudson County and New York City.  Additionally it would create mayhem for light rail passengers. I don't really see how this idea benefits anyone except concert promoters. 

The attempt at seizing Liberty State for Paul Fireman's personal gain is so clearly obvious here.   Because he has money to spread around to influence leglislators, we presently do not  have a protect Liberty State Park act.  For years he has had a posh golf course with promises to give back to the immediate area and he has done nothing.   People use Liberty State Park for walking, birthday parties, playing ball, cycling and enjoying the view, exactly the kind of things a park should be used for.  Please move forward considering the thousands of people who use the free space in LSP and don't have the money to spend on trying to convince people of their interests.  Privatization is not a plus for out of town visitors to LSP or the people of Jersey City.   Privatization of Liberty State Park is not a plus for Jersey City or for NJ.  A few ball fields or other recreation areas that would benefit the local population is acceptable, especially since the administration of Jersey City has done little in that area for public recreation programs.   I understand that no other state parks include recreational fields for local team sports, but Jersey City is more interested in facilitating building apartments for the wealthy instead of children's recreational needs. 

Thank you",3/10/2024 18:54,10.1.2.8
,Robert,,Fretz,,rmfretz@yahoo.com,"First, thank you for leading a transparent process to this point. I echo the sentiment from the hearing that 5 million visitors a year wouldn't happen if the park wasn't meeting a significant need in its present form. While there are areas of improvement needed and welcomed, maintaining the flexibility of the space must be paramount in planning. Permanent structures like stadiums and bleachers that can't be utilized in another manner when there are no games should be a non-starter. Every permanent structure lying dormant takes away from the flexibility that has made the park so inviting to millions of visitors every year.

It is extremely important to take a real look at the financial implications of limited use permanent structures as it applies to long term financial health and stability of the park's overall budget. Jersey City has not been able to generate the local demand to keep stadiums, performance venues, or even nationally recognized sports institutions afloat. Those resorting to well documented misinformation about this process are aware of that fact. Without a demonstrated regional or statewide demand, it seems irresponsible to add the financial burden of limited use permanent structures to the park's budget. This is particularly true if those structure's best case use scenarios, on weekends and summer months, will also negatively impact the experience of the millions who visit the park without these structures existing presently.

While I am generally opposed to permanent limited use facilities, even in reclaimed areas, I am very much in favor of a serious revamping of transportation options within the park to avoid paving open space. As someone who has arrived at the park via the light rail pushing a stroller to the waterfront, ridden to Caven Point from the Heights with my daughter, and arrived numerous times in numerous ways for a myriad of reasons, I know getting around the park can be challenging. At a minimum, a shuttle from the light rail station would help bring those who cannot drive or ride in enjoy the open space they may not otherwise be able to get to. 

This is particularly crucial for the southern improvements, which has no public transit option. As someone who has used the park and attended annual events in and adjacent to the park (Fleet Week, PGA, LPGA, etc.), those existing influxes of people already demonstrate the challenges of increased traffic in and around the park during peak times. Anything drawing more people to the park must put not drawing additional cars at the forefront of planning. Also, facilities like the aquatic center need to make sure the community can actually get to them, which as currently proposed would be a significant challenge to the estimated 40% of Jersey City households that lack cars. 

Finally, I have great hope for restoring the piers on the south end and the continued protection of Caven Point. The piers and Caven Point are regular stops, with this year being the first I've seen harbor seals after years of trying. The exposed rebar made me reluctant to take our youngest out to see them, but the nine that were there was spectacular with a zoom lens. In addition, our family and many others we know rely on Caven Point for the chance to ""walk through the woods"" observing birds and various paw prints in our city that otherwise lacks woodland trails.  The trails may not be long, but they can't be replicated elsewhere in the city, particularly ending at a great spot for a picnic and throw shells into the water. 
 
I realize the committee has a large task ahead of it. Please protect the flexible nature of the park. Thank you for your time.",3/10/2024 18:46,10.1.2.8

,Jacqueline,,O'Brien,,jackiekhost@hotmail.com,"Dear DEP Task Force, 
I attended the recent public meeting in LSP on the topic of revitalization and was dismayed to observe the members of the ironically-named “People’s Park Foundation” depart BEFORE the public comments on the agenda even began.  These people, who have deservedly earned their excellent reputations in JC community athletics, seem all too willing to sully and sacrifice their good names in support of a billionaire who cares for nothing except the revenue he can generate from a vulnerable, natural resource in our midst.  

What made such a sight even more upsetting is that these folks departed shortly after two of the members suggested that an “executive session” be held. 

It is a slap in the face to the many tireless, working-class, hearts-in-the-right-place folks who unselfishly dedicate their time and energy to preserving a rare natural gem in Jersey City’s crown for EVERYONE, not just for cronies of billionaire.  The members of the PPF seek to exploit and replace this natural urban oasis with a synthetic, pollution-and-traffic generating commercial monster.  That’s it.

Destroying what is truly the last natural frontier on this side of the Hudson is not the answer.   There ARE other options for creating a viable venue for the sorely-needed athletic resources for our youth.  It is the City’s responsibility to identify and allocate the necessary lands to pursue such a virtuous goal. 

The DEP must seek to uphold the “P” in its name.  Otherwise, it should consider changing the acronym to “DEE,” with the last “e” standing for “exploitation” and/or “extermination.”

Thank you for your consideration.  It is truly my fervent hope that this task force uphold its original plans for LSP (i. e.  Interior habitats plan, a flood resiliency plan with wetlands, open space and miles of paths).

Is there a plan for use of the fields by rec. teams/local schools, open time for pick up games? How about transporting groups to use the fields? I know that there are some local places where the fields are locked up and sit empty for most of the time, making the recreation space only available to a few, so it is important to have the field managed. 

Phase 2 - Track and field, skatepark and a community pool all sound great - same comments as far as accessibility to maximize use. Having a small concession (like many of the swim areas at State Park Lakes) would be good. Hopefully there will still be lots of open space for picnics and grilling. Also, I think it is very important to leave wild space with trails for the flora and fauna, and preserve Caven Point for wildlife habitat and education programs by the park rangers. 

It was discouraging to see such a large swath of the park razed of most trees and plants across from the Science Center. I do hope that this means there are remediation and plantings scheduled for this year, otherwise, it is likely to come back with a lot of the phragmites and other weed species, and will have to torn up/disrupted again.

Hereby this comment, I wish to express my strong support for the current effort to preserve and expand the open space element of the current design of Liberty State Park's (LSP) planned revitalization and my firm opposition to any and all attempts to monetize what is a uniquely precious public good in the name of private commercial recreation and entertainment. 

LSP is the crown jewel in the state's public park system. It provides all New Jerseyans and visitors to our great state both breathtaking views and ""breath catching"" respite from one of the most densely populated urban environments in the country, if not the world. I can think of no other place where one can reach out and almost touch the Statue of Liberty and the New York City skyline, and simultaneously have close encounters with a four-point buck and a herd of does, furtively fastidious muskrats, the soulful calls of Mourning Doves and chatty flocks of migrating Brant Geese. This spectacular intersection of our manmade and natural worlds is one that must be cherished and augmented, not compromised to make room for more conventional activities, which, while they have an important role to play in our community, it is certainly not one that should be inside the boundaries of this fragile parkland. 

I am already dismayed by the heavy bumper-to-bumper traffic that often clogs park roads on weekends and holidays. The introduction of yet more traffic-drawing venues threatens to turn this park into a just another one of our myriad parking lots. While I am all for dedicating a reasonable amount of park space to infrastructure for organized, non-commercial forms of recreation, culture and community education, such as sports, music, history, public art, nature walks, community gardens, etc., this infrastructure should serve the long-term health of the park's natural capital, not short-term monetary gains. 

The park's revitalization is an historic, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for today's generation to invest in something truly great that will generate enormous public benefit for generations to come.

Natural land and open space are scarce in our State of NJ & especially in the vicinity of Jersey City. 
The Governor, Politicians, and Private Groups should NOT be allowed to deface them and decrease the amount that still  exists in any way.

LSP, with its UNIQUE LOCATION, has been and should remain a Natural Parkland with its acreage of open and natural land. It has always been a destination for local City people and for visitors from all over NJ & the World who come to enjoy the open spaces and views of the  Hudson River, NYC & the Statue of Liberty.
  
Elected officials should not be considering to allow any private development of any part of the area which would deface the existing parkland and affect wildlife in their life cycles, the natural open spaces, and the fine views from the parkland, and add to traffic congestion & pollution in the Jersey City area.

ANY DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE THE WRONG DEVELOPMENT FOR THIS AREA.
NJ officials should be proud that this parkland exists and let it stay as it is for all to enjoy.

,Matthew,,Gulyas,,martinlockhart851@gmail.com,"As a new citizen to Jersey City, I feel that the utilization of a park meant for all designed for only a few is a terrible plan. The wildlife refuge within the park is important for the biodiversity of the city and the green space allows for absorption of any water should the area flood. The park acts a natural barrier also naturally housing deer and migrant bird species which are important for urban people like myself to interact with nature and know that such nature exists within the boundaries of a heavily urbanized region. Also, I have seen in others areas, the destruction of natural wildlife areas will never get rid of wildlife at all and the park will continue to utilized by animals no matter what. The proposed stadiums and concert venues will need high maintenance to even maintain them and so the cost to do will continuously rise over time due to excrement and waste from animals over time. These projects would lose money in the long run due to these costs. The park should be an open space with trails throughout the wildlife area and along the water front. The terminal can renovated to host community events and teach urban dwellers around the environment and educate others amount watercraft and such sports. The terminal can also serve as a marketplace for things such as farmers markets and full restoration would preserve the history of the park. The uses of public land for private purposes is symptomatic of misuse of city owned land that is meant for interactions with nature and a healthy lifestyle. Any construction of stadiums and other places for private use take away the value of the land from the public and any additional parking would destroy a park that is beloved by all and treasured by the citizens of Jersey City. It is for these reasons that I oppose the new plans by the newly appointed task force to benefit personally from the construction of stadiums and concert venues that would see money pass in their hands and not to the local government for the usage to provide services to citizens who need them the most. A park is something that, while being seen a waste of space to property developers, is treasured and used by citizens in an urbanized area to get away from the hustle and bustle of life and relax in the calm surroundings of nature.

I do not want the Recreation, Arts, and Culture facilities outlined in Phase 1B or most of the athletic facilities in the Long-term master plan (Phase 2) planned for Liberty State Park.  I think that they would ruin the park; in part, because they would take space away from the thousands of people who regularly already use the park for family reunions, picnics, exercise, and passive recreation.  More importantly, the staffing, upkeep, maintenance, and repair of these facilities would create a large expense, drawing money away from other parks, and creating a huge draw on state and DEP funds.  Money may be available short-term, but facilities like these would require a long-term commitment to a high level of funding.

The DEP has shown that it can manage its funds responsibly and balance the needs of people throughout the state, but funding comes through the legislature and there is no indication of how the legislature will fund the facilities outlined here long-term.  Long term funding will be a necessity.

We have nearby stadiums, entertainment venues, community centers, and athletic facilities that, even when they are more conveniently located than those proposed here, are already underused, underfunded, and in need of maintenance.   Adding more in Liberty State Park will not make the Park better and will not help improve the region.

If any area could be improved, it would be the areas now designated for the 'Community Center' and portion of the 2B near the intersection of Morris Pesin Blvd. and Burma Road.

,Matthew,,Byrne,,matttbyrne@usa.net,"Thank you in advance for considering my comments.  I have been a tenant at liberty landing marina for about 26 years and currently have a boat on F dock.  I cannot over emphasize the importance of keeping close and adequate parking for marina tenants.  With 520 slips, it is a fair estimate that the marina serves well in excess of 1000 people.  Many access their boats year round and at all hours of the day.  Close parking is critical to enable tenants to bring supplies (such as food, beverages, ice, boat parts, gasoline, propane, etc.) to their boats.  Also, many tenants are elderly, very young, and disabled.  Any shuttle vehicle used to bring tenants from remote parking will be inadequate as it will certainly not run 24x7x365 and allow hazardous supplies (such gasoline, propane, marine chemicals, flares, etc.).  Eliminating parking will kill the marina.  LLM is one of the most expensive marinas in the area.  If parking is removed or significantly reduced, boaters will simply move their boats elsewhere.  This will not only harm the marina's business but will also harm Liberty House and Maritime Parc, which receive a lot of business from the marina tenants.  On a nice weekend day during the summer, the parking lot is completely full.  As such, even reducing the number of parking spots by a small amount will not work.  In fact, the current parking would not even support users of the proposed ball fields who will need to bring supplies such as bats, balls, mits, bases, coolers, etc.  The current parking lots are also home to dumpsters used by marina tenants. On any given Sunday evening during the Summer, these dumpsters are full to the top.  Removing the dumpsters, reducing their number, or making them remote will simply result in litter in the park.  People will pile garbage in the dock gate houses and that garbage will be blown by the wind into the park and water.  It should also be noted that if baseballs hit boats, the costs for damages could be extremely high.  Many boats in the marina are worth millions of dollars.  A custom window for such a vessel could cost a fortune to replace.  Traffic on Audrey Zapp Drive is already horrible on a Summer weekend.  Please consider how badly this will increase when ball field users all arrive and leave at around the same time.  Finally, of all the proposals for a large ball field, the one with a single field and track centered on the grass could work provided that large parking areas are also provided on each side of it.  These areas should have the same number of spots as the current lot plus spots for ballfield users.  Thank you.",3/9/2024 12:34,10.1.2.9

Ecological Impact: The construction of the Athletics Hub will significantly alter the existing ecosystem. We must carefully assess the impact on local flora and fauna. Are there plans to mitigate disruption to wildlife habitats and native plant species? This will  compromising the park’s ecological balance.
Loss of Green Space: The Athletics Hub may consume a substantial portion of green space. While active recreation facilities are essential, we should question whether the trade-off is worth it. Can we achieve the same goals without sacrificing valuable natural areas?
Noise and Aesthetics: Sports facilities tend to generate noise—cheering crowds, amplified announcements, and athletic events. How will this affect the park’s tranquility? Additionally, the visual impact of large structures should be considered. Will the hub blend harmoniously with the park’s surroundings?
Community Engagement: Were local residents actively involved in the decision-making process? Community input is crucial to ensure that the hub aligns with the needs and desires of Jersey City residents. Transparent communication and genuine engagement are vital.
Maintenance Costs: Beyond construction, ongoing maintenance costs for the Athletics Hub must be evaluated. Will taxpayers bear the burden, or are there sustainable funding mechanisms? We don’t want a scenario where the hub becomes a financial strain on the park’s overall budget.
Alternative Locations: Could alternative locations outside the park serve as better sites for the Athletics Hub? Balancing recreational needs with environmental preservation might lead us to explore other options.

The Empty Sky Memorial needs to be repaired, restored, and completed and should be prior to 2026 -- the 25th anniversary of 9/11, the 50th anniversary of Liberty State Park, and when the World Cup hits New Jersey.


Items to resolve at the Empty Sky Memorial include:  

•	Integrate TRIBUTE to 9/11 responders and survivors, inc those victims succumbing to 9-11 related illness due to the attacks (this is NOT an ""addition"" to the original 2004 memorial design or State request of 9/11 remembrance -- any suggestion otherwise is materially false. Happy to substantiate).
•	Add NJ 9/11/01 victim names currently missing on the memorial walls 
•	Restore 65 autumn weeping cherry TREES (they were killed due to being left in drought conditions and not provided water -- there is an irrigation system embedded in the memorial mound).
•	Restore broken LIGHTING at base of memorial walls to illuminate victims’ names as originally designed
•	Modernize tech (inc QR code) of the DIRECTORY KIOSKS so finding a name is always possible
•	Restore memorial PLAZA where stainless steel ACCESSORIES have been stripped away and replaced with plastic
•	Memorial Preservation Manual (with protocols for things like what to do to add a name).
•	Include an accessible educational component -- including languages other than english. 5+ million international visitors visit the memorial every year, it is a key landmark on the Federal National 9/11 Memorial Trail, the stop before (or after) the National 9/11 memorial and there is no educational component currently at Empty Sky describing its meaning.

Thank you.

It provides natural open green space to relax and be active in nature, which is difficult to come by in a big city and essential for our mental health. I support cleaning up the contaminated areas, creating nature trails and increased public transportation so more people can enjoy the park without adding more traffic to the area. I STRONGLY oppose privatization of any kind including a sports stadium and amphitheater. There's plenty of those around here already. What we lack is open green spaces, hiking trails, and better public transportation, so I hope the revitalization will include those things.",3/8/2024 18:09,10.1.2.4

Right now it seems that project is too much for a place called ""state park"". Lot 11 should be a green space - this boat parking is an eye soar for years, baseball field is absolutely not appropriate for that park, there should be trail for walking and for jogging, some small fields for tennis, basketball or volleyball are also good. Liberty State Park should not become sport arena, but a place to rest, connect with nature - so more native gardens would be appreciated, more animals/birds observations points.

(That parcel of land isn't earning financial profits, and that makes it a desirable land grab. But the land still has immense value in its current use.

,Henry,,Pullin,,hpullin@njsea.com,"I am 38 years old and was born and raised in Jersey City. I attended summer camp at Camp Liberty for many years, from an early age until I basically aged out. I feel like I know this city and Liberty State Park well. Last Sunday, the day after the ""Task Force Meeting"" and public comment session, I took my parents and some family members who were visiting from out of town to Liberty State Park for a walk. We got the full experience of what Liberty State Park has to offer. Along the Hudson River, we saw the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, Governors Island, and the Skylines and bridges of NYC. As we walked along the paths we saw the lawns, playgrounds, memorials, historic sites, remnant sandy beaches, wetland areas, and forested uplands throughout the park. This was my cousins' first time in Jersey City, they were amazed by what Liberty State Park has to offer. They were literally daydreaming out loud about all of the activities they could engage in at Liberty State Park. There were also so many other people in the park when we were there, people that appeared to be from a huge variety of different backgrounds. Many people sounded like they were from other countries based on their conversations and the languages they spoke. People were strolling, riding bikes, playing sports, observing nature, barbecuing, playing on playgrounds, lounging in hammocks, sitting and observing the scenery, and engaging in countless other activities. All these people appeared to be enjoying themselves very much and they all, in their own way, appeared to be connecting with the same nature, history, and culture that my family and I were connecting with. Liberty State Park has always offered visitors access to resources that are extremely difficult to find in the middle of a dense urban area, and based on the number of visitors, the activities they were engaging in, and the spirits in the park last Sunday, it is clear that Liberty State Park, in its current state, is a wildly successful park.

Based on my experience last Sunday I would like to update my public comment. I initially stated that there may be some room for non-commercial sports fields, but I really don't think there is space in the park. At first glance or on an aerial image it may appear like there is space to spare in Liberty State Park but between parking and the field itself sports fields would use up precious park space quickly. Sports fields also severely limit the types of activities people can engage in on the land where they are located. Basically, people are only able to engage in the sport that the field is designed for. Additionally, sports fields are only used during select seasons, at limited hours, and usually require permits to use. To add to the point about limited space in the park, last Sunday, when I visited the park, it was an exceptionally warm and beautiful day after a long winter, the weather probably explains the massive amount of people in the park that day, but this park is a very popular destination year-round. When we were at the park it was very difficult to find parking and when we left it took a very long time to exit the park, traffic was backed up well into the city streets. Adding fields that attract large amounts of attendees, buses, etc. will only further exacerbate this issue. Doing so could potentially make the traffic much worse and this would be very detrimental to the park. There may be some opportunity for smaller courts intended for active recreation but they should be located near existing parking and not be built at the expense of natural areas (Brooklyn Bridge Park features an excellent example of a concentrated active recreation area). For-profit operations, such as sports arenas or other types of venues, should absolutely not be constructed in the park. Also, on a more general level, I would like to echo some of the comments I heard during the public comments session. State parks are designed to protect areas of natural or historic significance, they are not obligated to provide active recreation opportunities to a city, in this case, that is Jersey City or Hudson County's responsibility. The NJDEP's plans to improve the interior of the park, such as the constructed freshwater and saltwater wetlands and other habitats are truly visionary and sustainable. These improvements are in line with the spirit of the park and they expand and enhance successful elements of the park. This is the direction we should be moving with the park.

I would also like to comment on the elephant in the room. The Liberty State Park ""Task Force"" was clearly created through a billionaire's lobbying efforts. This billionaire has also essentially bought off members of the task force as well as other select community leaders through lobbying and ""donations"" to nonprofits. The task force is clearly a proxy group set up to push the goals of the billionaire. This same billionaire has been trying to make land grabs in the park to expand the golf course he owns that is adjacent to the park for years. There is no mistaking that what the park is going through now is an effort by a billionaire to derail well-planned DEP improvements to the park. The billionaire's motivations are not entirely clear but he is likely doing this in an effort to eventually expand his golf course, work his way into some potential business opportunity he sees in the park, simply out of spite, or some combination of these motivations. Whatever his motivations, at this point, there is no reason he shouldn't think he can't achieve his goals, he has already created a government-sanctioned ""Task Force"" to push his agenda and he has brought much of the park planning to a screeching halt and back to square one. Additionally, he is pushing his agenda through the most despicable of ways. By sprinkling in vague accusations of the park not being accessible to some neighborhoods and not accommodating certain types of uses, while actually working to derail the park improvement process to eventually achieve his own personal and financial goals, the billionaire is opportunistically taking advantage of, corrupting, and undermining truly virtuous social justice movements. While there are some legitimate access issues at Liberty State Park, such as difficult access to the park from underserved neighborhoods, this is something the DEP is on working to resolve. The billionaire who has been trying to take park land away from the public for years did not work so hard to raise issues of access, this was done in an effort to create confusion and opportunities for him to achieve his goals. We all know this, I would just like to say that the behavior of this billionaire should not be catered to.

Lastly, many of the amenities, outside of large-scale for-profit stadiums and public sports fields, that task force members and pro-active recreation public commenters expressed concern over the park lacking, already exist in the park. There are heavily used playgrounds and Camp Liberty provides safe, affordable daycare and programming during the summer months. This is not to say that these offerings can't be expanded on, it should just be recognized that they exist already.

In summary: 
- The park is already well-used and successful
- State parks are not required to provide active recreation, active recreation is the city's responsibility
- There is not enough space in the park to develop sports fields (even after areas that are closed to the public are opened)
- Constructing sports fields would be detrimental to wildly successful park elements and create bad traffic congestion
- Improvements should only expand on what is successful in the park already (access to nature and history)
- The personal agenda of a billionaire should never be catered to on public land

,Mark,,Uriu,,Uriu123@gmail.com,"Liberty State Park presents a unique opportunity to create a vast park of naturalized wetland, public recreation and athletic facilities on the last large undeveloped tract on NY Harbor. It will provide the urban citizens of this region free access to nature, open space and recreation. It has been proven repeatedly thru history how access to natural settings vastly improves the quality of life in a city, particularly for the folk who don’t have the easy means to get to the country.  Calvert and Vaux, creators of many great urban parks, are rightly held in high esteem.  Commercial concert and sports venues are much better, more interesting and more accessible when they are integrated into an urban street matrix. To place them in Liberty State Park with their requisite parking lots and built up facilities, would be squandering this region’s last great opportunity to create something really special. 

To limit public access to this huge resource through privatization, whether it be to a members only golf course or for a pay to enter sports/concert venue is just plain wrong. There are much more appropriate places for that kind of private enterprise. 

Those who characterize the climate change resiliency features of a naturalized park as “flooding” are factually incorrect and have learned nothing from Superstorm Sandy. It does beg the question, what is motivating this cynical manipulation of facts and why are some of our politicians going along with it? 

The bottom line is that Liberty State Park is uniquely suitable for development into naturalized parkland and low density athletic facilities and not into higher density entertainment venues.

,Brian,,Goldin,,briandgoldin@gmail.com,"I’m a long-time boater in the marina and as representative of the community with some of the most regular access to the park, we understand the importance of maintaining and promoting access to the water. Our collective efforts have brought a wide range of activities to the park, enriching the experiences of visitors and residents alike.

As tenants of the marina, we represent a vibrant community comprising approximately over 500 boats, spanning nearly the entire length of the Morris Canal. Beyond ourselves and neighboring tenants, we also serve as a gateway for a steady stream of visiting recreational boaters, jet skiers, sailing clubs, weekly sailboat racing enthusiasts, fishermen, and numerous small and large charter boats. Our marina provides countless opportunities for residents and tourists alike to access the water and enjoy various aquatic activities.

We are deeply concerned about the proposed changes that could potentially have negative impacts on our community. It is crucial that any revitalization plans take into account the diverse needs and activities facilitated by the marina, ensuring continued access to the water and preserving the unique character of our waterfront environment.

Vehicle Access and Parking: The availability of convenient vehicle access to the marina and well-designed parking facilities is not a luxury but a necessity to ensure the marina's continued functionality and appeal. Adequate parking not only serves the needs of boaters and visitors but also supports the provisioning, servicing, and repair of boats, activities that require frequent trips to parking areas where heavy equipment, supplies, tools and other items need to and from both personal and service vehicles.

Waste Management: Efficient waste management services in the marina area are indispensable to prevent environmental pollution and safeguard the integrity of both the park and its surrounding water bodies. Currently the marina has a large dumpster next to each dock that is often filled to capacity and The current plan's disregard for proper waste disposal provisions raises grave concerns about potential litter and hazardous waste contaminating our water, endangering aquatic life and ecosystems. Adequate vehicle access and robust waste management are fundamental aspects of environmental stewardship, directly aligning with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection's mission to protect our state's environment.

User Experience and Economic Development: A well-maintained marina, complemented by seamless vehicle access and essential services, is pivotal for enhancing the overall user experience. Such improvements attract more visitors, fostering positive economic and community benefits. Local businesses, including restaurants, shops, and service providers, benefit from a thriving marina to flourish and contribute to our community's prosperity.

Emergency Services Access: Furthermore, the proposed plan glaringly neglects the critical need for easy access by emergency services, including police, fire, and ambulances, to the marina and its boat slips. In times of emergencies or water-related accidents, swift response times can be the difference between life and tragedy. It is deeply concerning that the current plan falls short in prioritizing unimpeded access for emergency services, a matter of utmost importance that should take precedence in any revitalization endeavor.

Related to Athletics: I have substantial reservations regarding the proposed athletic fields and their proximity to the marina. The proximity of the athletic fields threatens to disrupt marina access, increase traffic and noise levels, contribute to excessive light pollution, and potentially compromise the visual appeal and tranquility of the marina. It seems that the planners may be attempting to fit the athletic fields into a space that is too small to accommodate them adequately, raising several significant concerns that should be carefully addressed.

I’m concerned that the current plans divert from the Liberty State Park's core essence captured in the 1978 planning document, which emphasized its identity as a place of natural beauty and serenity. Given its status as a state park with national significance, I firmly believe that the park should remain committed to preserving its natural landscape, offering scenic views, and fostering an environment that celebrates nature. Introducing athletic fields may compromise the park's natural integrity, and I urge that careful consideration be given to the original vision for Liberty State Park.

Liberty State Park's unique beauty and historical significance deserve to be upheld for future generations to cherish. I appeal to all stakeholders involved in the revitalization plan to consider these concerns seriously and work collaboratively towards a solution that honors the legacy and future of Liberty State Park.

I'd be happy to meet with the task force to discuss these ideas and to help in any way that I can.",3/5/2024 17:47,10.1.2.8

As an avid visitor to the park ,there is no way commercialized stadiums are in the parks best interest . A few things I hope will make it into the design , are  more  affordable options for a family visiting the park to enjoy something to eat . The current restaurants are beautiful , but for a family of four looking to enjoy a small bite to eat or drink , those restaurants are really not an option, some kind of concession stand like what was here in the past would be nice .  Another addition I think would benefit the park , is a covered stage with electricity for concerts and possibly theatrical   plays in the park . A covered stage would benefit the musicians and there equipment in the heat of summer , also ,with already having permanent electricity  it would eliminate the need for gas powered generators which are currently used .

Liberty State Park is just that a ""State"" ""Park"" belonging to the people of ""New Jersey"" and not the special interests of a billionaire real estate developer. It holds an important place in not only the history of New Jersey but also the country. It remains one of the last substantial open space in Norther New Jersey and as such should remain so. The land does not belong solely to the residents of Jersey City and the greater New Jersey community should be considered. The Park is situated adjacent to the State of Liberty and Ellis island National Parks, and does not and should be developed as Recreation Facility serving Jersey City that the city does not need, despite the self serving arguments in opposition to the DEP's plan. The group back by Fireman, has preyed and continues upon the people of Jersey City, using them as pawns in his efforts to execute a major land grab that can not and should not be permitted. The DEP's plan takes a farm more holistic approach to this historic site, providing for some of those recreational needs of the local residents, while maintaining open space and restoring and repurposing some of the historical structures in the park. The alternative plan proposed by Fireman proposes to develop far too much of the existing open space, proposing facilities far in excess of the needs of the community and the state, while paving over much needed open space. The oppositions arguments that their paln will provide facilities to urban residents that exist in the suburbs is fiction, as there are no such facilities the size and scope proposed anywhere in the state. Rather the development should be viewed through the lens of protecting and providing the green space to the urban communities that suburban New Jersey residents enjoy and should be protected and maintained and celebrated at whatever cost.",3/5/2024 12:14,10.1.2.8
,Lisa,,Simms,,LSimms@njtreefoundation.org,"Phase 1B – Audrey Zapp Corridor
There is way, way too much crammed into a very small area of the park. It is excessive. Football, soccer, little league, tennis, basketball and an event lawn. Where will all these folks park? The lights and noise will be horrific. How does this have anything to do with enjoyment of a state park? A lot of editing should be done. One multi-purpose field is sufficient. No skate park in or near the Grove of Remembrance. There is a skate park right up the street from LSP in Barry Lane Park. No viewing areas, and no new paths crisscrossing the Grove! There are more access routes going through the 9/11 Grove of Remembrance, Millenium Park and the LSP north side than there are in the entire 151 acres of the interior. It is way, way too much. The 9/11 Grove of Remembrance has two excellent paths - one paved, active path and one meandering, passive walkway. That is more than enough. Neither the Grove nor the park needs a train. What happened to Never Forget? 

A bicycle path could be constructed next to Audrey Zapp Drive as long as the roots of the mature, 20-year-old Grove of Remembrance trees, which are providing huge environmental benefits, are not destroyed. Perhaps a floating bike path? Innovation with a focus on demonstrating environmentally sound park improvements should be the plan here.  Every path and road should be made of porous pavement. The removal of ANY 20-year-old tree defeats the purpose of environmental sustainability and environmental justice for Jersey City folks. Innovative, sustainable ideas, please. 

The task force had some nice ideas for the train shed, but again, editing is needed. Folks spend entire days in Central Park because it has SOME activities, and many passive activities. No one NEEDS 150 activities in a park. Editing, please. Lots of it.

Phase 2A
Southern Athletic hub
It would seem prudent to fast-track the active recreation component of the Phase 2A. This would create the much demanded active recreation while taking pressure off the rest of the park for ballfields, courts, etc. Make the cleanup and design of this area a priority and focus to alleviate most, if not all, of the active recreation demands. The southern side of the park, in those 50-acreas designated for active recreation, should be the hub of recreation. There’s more parking to accommodate this. The task force members who truly care about Jersey City youth, should decide what kind of recreation will be installed in the southern hub. The quieter area of LSP should be the northern side. 

Phase 2B
 The “existing boat launch area” green space along Morris Pesin Drive from Freedom Way to the Burma Road Grove is filled with trees planted by the NJ Tree Foundation & Friends of Liberty State Park. Starting in 2006 and continuing until about 2019, a diversity of trees (both species and age) were planted to create shade for picnicking and relaxing. As such, many of those trees have been in the ground for 15 years and are supplying much needed ecological benefits. No redesign of any kind should happen in this buffer area.

The waterfront area should be left alone. Liberty State Park is not Six Flags. Plant trees. Shade the walkways. End of story. And, at all costs, PROTECT CAVEN POINT! 

The task force should NOT be allowed to meet in privacy. Full stop. Every minute of every conversation should be open to the public and videotaped. No closed ‘executive sessions’. You could tell from some of the task force members comments that they “felt the cameras” – this is a good thing, creating open, honest dialog that is so important to a community-based process. No closed sessions. Also, task force members should be required to stay until the last community member has spoken. No exceptions. If they cannot remain to hear what the community wants, then they should not be on the task force. Additionally, task force members should come to the meetings prepared – not reading the 174 pages of public input is unacceptable. This is an important commitment and should be taken seriously.",3/5/2024 9:24,10.1.2.8

,Mark,,Trainer,,mark.trainer1@live.com,"Hello,

Overall, I'm very excited about the plans for Liberty State Park and think it is heading in the right direction by balancing passive nature with active recreation and community-orientation at the north end. My specific comments are below.
- I prefer the original concept for the North Athletics Club over the proposal alternatives. There is a dearth of large spaces for healthy active recreation in Central Jersey City and this is an ideal location in a beautiful setting. I'm especially supportive of the running track and soccer field in this location to appeal to the broadest potential user base. I think it makes sense to keep this section of the northern park as the sports focused area with more passive areas elsewhere. I also believe the boat yard should be repurposed to a more community-wide benefitting use if possible.
- I prefer the South of Cove Amphitheater option. This will provide amazing skyline and park views and I think it will feel less congested than including it on the north side next to the beach. I prefer the wood bench on grass terraces seating option as it has a more natural feel than the concrete.
- On transportation, I believe we should encourage non-car modes of travel to the greatest extent possible and repurpose some of the proposed parking spaces toward passive green space. I support a robust shuttle system and think there should be significant investment in making a pleasant transfer experience from both the Liberty State Park light rail station and Grove Street PATH station.
- On Phase 2, I believe the focus should be on supporting more unstructured recreational opportunities and the ability to escape from the City. I think some athletic facilities at the Southern Athletics Hub make sense but that the rest of the area should be more passive in focus.

I am deeply concerned and frankly outraged that any plan to develop the area of Liberty State Park into commercial indoor sports venues for private profiteering off public land is even being considered. LSP is an important public use outdoor space and wildlife refuge, and it's crucial that it remain that way. I'd like to voice my overwhelming support for the DEP plan to create a wildlife refuge and passive recreation, open to the public, for visitors of the park. 

Not only is the park a wildlife refuge, it's also at severe risk for flooding. Developing concrete structures and sidewalks puts the entire downtown Jersey City area at worse risk of flooding by removing a large water drainage area. We cannot allow a billionaire to destroy the ecosystem for wildlife and people by developing on this land. 

All in all, entertaining the outlandish notion of constructing privately held arenas, rinks, and other concrete monstrosities on public green space is absolutely ridiculous. Under no circumstances can the beauty and vibrancy of Liberty State Park be destroyed in favor of paid indoor entertainment.

,Friends of,,Liberty State Park,,friendsoflibertystatepark@gmail.com,"Friends of LSP PHASE 2 statement on Freedom Way Corridor and Pesin Drive Corridor and also Opposing Structured Active Recreation in the Phase 2 “Freedom Way Corridor” of the Waterfront Great Green Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk, and north to south between ferry lot and gravel road just before Nature Center.

This statement doesn't include the already planned Phase 1A  and doesn't address at this point, the 50 acres of free active recreation on south side of the Interior.

“Freedom Way Corridor” recommendations
Maybe there’s space for another sensibly located playground and shaded picnic tables to be near a shuttle bus stop but not interfering with Green Park's 88 acre festivals footprints. Also there needs to be the safest bike paths possible in both directions of Freedom Way (it was suggested to perhaps lessen the space on Freedom Way islands for those bike paths as it'd be hard to do with the ""Belgian blocks"" having been installed on the eastern side of Freedom Way). Also water fountain stations along Freedom Way and if possible next to Liberty Walk.

""Morris Pesin Drive” corridor
 The main entrance to LSP with Lady Liberty 2000 feet away from the Scenic Overlook South Lawn. LSP’s south side is the Non-Commercial Family and Friends Picnicking Side of LSP! It mainly needs creative rehabilitation of the 3 historic jetties for walking, fishing, signage, etc.(easternmost jetty has a tiny beach for kayak launching). The southside picnic tables are new since Sandy; the playground is 5 years old, and what google maps is calling the “Pesin Drive Grove” of about 158 trees the Friends planted between the boat launch lot 2 and lot 3 is getting increasingly more popular for picnics and barbecues- especially with the original picnic table area by the office filled up on nice weekends. Also, the sidewalk along LSP’s southside and by the original picnic table area is overdue for renovation.

On the Great Lawn between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk:
LSP’s priceless waterfront 88-acre Great Lawn must be preserved for its essential and irreplaceable purpose of green free urban scarce open space in the ""Freedom Way Corridor"". 

The funded surrogates of billionaire Fireman will likely push sports facilities for the 88-acre Waterfront Great Green Lawn - despite the 50 acres promised in LSP’s interior and some acres along Zapp Dr. and in southside’s lot 1.
It'd be like building sports facilities in Central Park's ""Great Lawn”. NYC residents would not accept that for one second! LSP’s Waterfront Great Green Lawn – the Green Park - is essential for varied urban open space activities and periodic special event festivals.
Structured active recreation sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Green Lawn would cast aside LSP’s primary purpose as a public, green, free, urban scarce, priceless open space for unstructured active recreation, passive recreation and nature enjoyment. It would be an obscene crime to assault the most important urban open space lawn in the USA! 

An editorial once stated that the dramatic, panoramic view from LSP is the ""signature view of our civilization” - American soul-stirring and heart-stirring views from the Great Green Lawn's open space. The waterfront lawn, known as the ""Green Park”, is one of the most important urban open space lawns in the world with the dramatic vistas toward NYC, Lady Liberty, Ellis Island and river/bay - going east to west between Freedom Way and Liberty Walk and including Freedom Way’s playground, and going north to south between the ferry parking lot and cherry tree hill by the Nature Center. 

That waterfront lawn is deserved by future generations of urban people for their quality of life for unstructured active recreation and passive recreation, and is crucial for periodic special events which raise some revenue and bring people to the park to enjoy cultural events such as the past Star-Ledger Jazz Festival, All Points West rock festival, kite festivals, last year's Juneteenth festival, Veuve Clicquot Polo event etc. Sports facilities in the Waterfront Great Lawn would prevent/interfere with a needed footprint for use of the Green Ring and Crescent Lawn areas for large special events which sometimes go northward toward the large playground.

The best plan for structured active recreation is the 50 interior acres, the lawn by the marina (but not taking away boaters’ parking spaces, and the 2 acres in southside’s Lot 1.

All of LSP including the waterfront Great Green Lawn is our urban backyard and America’s Great Lawn and is an essential emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual public health resource -an urban haven, oasis, refuge, sanctuary and escape for people to get away from the crowded, congested, and noisy Jersey City. Overwhelmingly expressed in 47 years of battles is that LSP’s urban green open space is its highest, best, and wisest use for now and future generations- for unstructured active recreation such as, walking, running, biking, pick-up games, playgrounds, kids running free in grass, families and friends kicking or throwing balls, kites, dog-walking, etc., and passive recreation like picnics, BBQs, relaxing on benches and blankets, birding, view-watching and taking scenic photos.

Festivals are awesome LSP cultural uses but only done periodically so LSP doesn’t become the PNC Arts Center with every weekend traffic jams blocking access to regular LSP users on summer weekends -no matter how many shuttles. LSP is already jampacked on all nice weekends and the habitats and trails, active recreation, Terminal re-use is coming.

Many urban residents have no front yard or backyard and may go away for a day or two to the beach in the summer but we don't have summer homes and LSP visits are the highlight of people's lives - to come alone, or with family or friends to chill, bond, play, create memories.

In the ""briefing"" document for this travesty task force (established by the billionaire's LSP law), Commissioner Shawn LaTourette’s first line was that LSP is one of the few remaining contiguous open green spaces along the highly developed northern NJ/NYC waterfront.

I'm sure people anywhere who had a Great Lawn facing NYC’s skyline and the Statue of Liberty, harbor, etc. would want to keep the Great Lawn as it is, with soul-soothing walkways and bikeways, gardens, and trees (but not trees in middle of unstructured active rec open space ).",3/3/2024 18:01,10.1.2.4

I wasn't allowed to read my statement at the task force meeting to save time but I was told that I could speak during the public comment portion but I decided not to with the meeting going till 4:30. So here's my statement for the public record on behalf of the Friends of Liberty State Park and myself at the task force member:  I'll start by stating that it was sickening that task force members who have gotten Fireman money and at least three of the political patronage appointees left before the public speaking:
                     
The Friends of LSP strongly support the responsible, inclusive, democratic DEP Revitalization” process of professional park-design planning consultants presenting proposals for essential robust public participation input, and also input from this task force. The Friends are serving under protest on this travesty task force.

The task force was set up in the fast-tracked law passed by billionaire Paul Fireman’s lobbyists and the task force includes his two front groups, heads of nonprofits he’s funded, others who support the Sports and Entertainment Complex"" and some misinformed political patronage appointees. As reported in the news, Fireman's front group headed by Hurley has revived their Sports and Entertainment Complex assault on the park with this new version being a 5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue.

His front groups pushed lies and smear attacks to kill the LSP Protection Act and for two years and pushed their exclusionary, traffic-jam causing, admission-fee Sports and Entertainment Complex plan which cast aside decades of the overwhelming broad public consensus, by many 10’s of 1000’s of people wanting a Central Park type Park. The Protection Act which would’ve protected the Caven Point Natural Area which Fireman still wants and would’ve banned the destructive Sports and entertainment Complex.  The Protection Act had 33K petition signers & 111 Coalition groups. 
The Commissioner thankfully and heroically rejected their public land grab last May but with zero respect for the public land behind LSP, they’ve revived it and ignore that the DEP has promised 60 acres for free structured active recreation.

This is an obvious attempt to grab profit and influence off of an unnecessary development project that would (1) disrespectfully destroy a pristine, untouched gem of land along the mouth of the Hudson River (with the world’s best view of the Statue of Liberty and lower Manhattan), with no close duplicate or equal on Earth, (2) waste city resources on a highly expensive, completely unnecessary project that would create barriers to access of this precious, public land, and (3) fly in the face of clear public opinion on the issue. We have very little green space in this city, state and region of our country, and public spaces are critically important to the mental health of city residents, both rich and poor. For further clarity, without Liberty State Park’s vast, freely accessible acreage, I would genuinely not want to live in Jersey City anymore - I could afford to do so financially (though others with lesser means would continue to be squeezed out of public enjoyment of their own land, which is despicable), but approval of Mr. Fireman’s plan would clearly demonstrate to me that Jersey City is not serious about protecting its only nature sanctuary; worse yet, it would illustrate that this city would auction off its only meaningful public land to make some extravagantly wealthy developers a few more bucks, seemingly only in exchange for political backing and an excuse to trumpet the city’s “accomplishment” in making the city somehow more “luxurious” and “desirable”. The park is desirable as is and many of my friends of similar age and means have also expressed that they would leave Jersey City if Fireman’s plans are approved. There are plenty of other towns in New Jersey, New York, the US, and the world that prioritize public land, access to nature and the associated mental health aspects therewith (including my hometown of Tewksbury Township, NJ). Your tax base will leave you if you move forward with Paul Fireman’s plan - the ball is now in your court to choose. Thank you for your consideration.",3/2/2024 22:35,10.1.2.6

,Kerry,,Bass,,kerrybass@verizon.net,"Hello - my name is Kerry Bass and I'm the chair of Sustainable Verona in NJ. I would urge you to google the University of Barcelona study of water samples taken between 2014 and 2021. Artificial turf grass accounted for 15% of larger plastics found in samples within about a half-mile of the shoreline.  As the artificial grass breaks down, small pieces of plastic make their way into soil and waterways, contributing to plastic pollution. Ocean plastics like those near Barcelona threaten animals and ecosystems. For example, birds, fish, and turtles mistake plastic for prey. Their stomachs can become lined with it, causing them to starve. They may also suffer from infections, cuts, internal injuries, and reduced swimming abilities.

And that's only one of the things that our team has discovered wrong with artificial turf.  Artificial turf causes more injury than natural grass. There is a study that looked at 53 articles published between 1972 and 2020. The studies concluded higher rates of injuries on turf. The president of the NFL Player's Union posted a letter stating that artificial turf is harder on the body than natural grass. The studies all point to more injuries with artificial turf.

Most recently, a Philadelphia Inquirer article postulated the risk between artificial turf and cancer. Those risks should cause great concern.

I would urge you to take a look at the studies and literature out there highlighting all the problems with artificial turf. The general public is not aware of these problems, and only sees shiny new fields. As planners and designers, it is your duty to take all of the downsides into consideration. Wouldn't it be great if Jersey City could take the lead in enhancing our environment rather than causing it more harm?",3/2/2024 19:45,10.1.2.9

I did appreciate the comment that the Phase 2 athletic hub be composed of configurable and modular infrastructure to respond to flexible and ever-changing needs in our diverse state. 

Additionally, on Phase 1B, I think it best to put tennis or racquet courts on that northern cove lot for three reasons: 1) helps shave down but doesn’t eliminate marina parking; 2) once they’re in there, they’re relatively low-cost and resilient infrastructure that is in popular demand; and 3) it will make it harder for a future administration to rip them out in favor of another type of sporting facility due to loss aversion.

While I applaud the provisions for the wide range of various community athletic activities proposed for the northern and southern ends the of the park and the cultural uses for the train shed, devoting such a huge portion of the land to only two enormous venues (namely the stadium and the auditorium) would monopolize entirely too much space that cannot then be used for a lot of other purposes.  Not everyone who uses Liberty State Park is into athletics.  Some people enjoy just taking long walks amidst unobstructed scenery or hanging out while contemplating the beauty of nature.  Another issue is that, if 5000 or 7000 cars try all at once to get onto the two-lane roads servicing the area surrounding Liberty State Park after a big concert or tournament, the congestion would be unimaginable.  Even as it is now, without the stadium or the auditorium, traffic on the back roads can jam up for miles during rush hour.  The stadium and the auditorium would simply worsen the problem.  The stadium and the auditorium would also obstruct the view of the skylines, the bay and the Statue of Liberty.  In a part of the country where there is already a decreasing amount of open space, Liberty State Park offers an oasis for people who need to get away from urban sprawl for a few hours.  I also wish to register my opposition to any plans to turn Caven Point into a golf course.  This wildlife habitat needs to be preserved.  I go to Liberty State Park two or three times each week and consider it a priceless resource to protect and cherish, not just for myself but for the Hudson County community, the nation and for the world travelers that put the park on their must-see lists.

Regarding today's presentation, I not support the inclusion of athletic fields in Liberty State Park. While I understand the desire to provide opportunities for youth woefully served by Jersey City, I think such an action will only encourage the city to continue to ignore their responsibilities.I also think such facilities will be difficult to manage and maintain. If however, athletic fields must be included, they should be built inland, away from the water, and in places with easy access from outside the park. There should be minimal, if any, cost for youth teams to utilize such fields should they be built.

Lastly, I believe that all subsequent Design Task Force meetings, and indeed any meetings relevant to the future of LSP,  remain open to the public.

This park belongs to the entire state, not a billionaire whose ulterior motives are clear as day, nor even to a select group of Jersey City residents who think it belongs solely to them.

The plans put forth by the People’s Park Foundation and their acolytes would irreparably change what is one of the country’s true hidden gems. It seems their only goal is to cram as much concrete and as many fields as humanly possible. If they want to found a northern version of IMG Academy, their billionaire financier is welcome to do so — but not on public land that belongs to the entire state. They could not care less about preserving the natural element of the park - which is precisely what makes it so beautiful and so unique.

2. There has been no official report that has been published that proves bringing water in the park will prevent flooding in surrounding Jersey City. Publish the documents from the Army Corp (they were present at the ribbon cutting) that show Phase 1a will not prevent flooding in the city. Data rules, not words from elected officials. Publish the data from the state engineers. We do not need more flooding in the city. 

3. We need more active recreation. I understand jersey city government is the issue. The city government has forgotten its citizens, but this is an urban park with 300k plus people living around the park. Open it up for active recreation and a community center. We need a community center. The kids need an outlet and there is 600 acres in the park. 

4. The notion of commercialization and making money off the park by Paul Fireman is absurd. Sam Pesin and the friends have receive checks from many events that come in LSP. Polo Classic $50k to FOLSP. Tough Mudder 10k check. Who is profiting off the park. Let’s ask Mr. Pesin. All money that comes to this park should be plowed back in to the park. LSP is running an annual deficit. Money should not line Sam Pesin’s pockets. Make it go back in the park. 

5. We need bathroom and concession stands. We talk about a Central Park like park. Well Central Park has bathrooms, coffee shops, 21 baseball fields, tennis courts, pickle ball, basketball, tennis, handball, a museum and a zoo. People pay money to use the boats on the lake and go to the zoo. Not everything in life is free and money then goes to run and update the facilities.

Urban humans have a deep and real need for open green space and access to nature. Some active recreation areas for local youth is a good compromise for this location. [Artificial turf needs to be avoided for all the reasons stated. It is essentially poisonous to the land -including the fish that the anglers come to the park for.] I even find myself approving the idea for an amphitheater, as proposed, fitting into the land.

Any confusion (or disinformation) about the wetlands plan demonstrates the lack of understanding of the importance of wetlands in the first place. That makes their inclusion even more important -- along with some good signage!

Over the long term, the 'greatest deficit' of this region will increasingly be open green space and access to nature. Liberty State Park is uniquely positioned to be that asset. As precious and worth fighting for as it is now, just think how much more uniquely valuable it will become as this area becomes even more highly populated.

I fully agree with the overwhelming tide of public opinion today that favors open green space--green space that is true to the park's natural state as possible.  People who study education and child development say that exposure to nature is one of the best gifts and learning experiences a child can have.  

Expensive, enlightened private schools know this and many make exposure to nature a core part of their mission. Many local residents cannot afford a private school experience, but If Liberty State Park is preserved as a natural green space, it will be available free to local, regional, and visiting children to have personal, immersive experience with nature.  

For a half century, Camp Liberty has done an outstanding job of giving local children a great experience of recreation in nature.  Tuition is reasonable and there are scholarships for many who need them.  Camp Liberty educators make great use of Liberty State Park's natural environment.   I am sure that many school teachers use the park for educational programs in nature as well.

,John,,Joseph,,jonvjoe@yahoo.com,"Thank you for the presentation and discussion today (March 2nd) at the Liberty State Park Design Task Force Meeting.  I broadly support the plan as it stands. My comments  :

* I support reducing the space between the sports facilities in the north side next to the Marina. I also like the idea of keeping parking further away and using public transportation / bike shares etc., to bring people to the sites. Any parking lot should emphasize secure bicycle parking and have trees set in a way to shield it from public view. 
* I like the wider natural seating options for the amphitheater. My preference is for the amphitheater to be located on the north side of the cove.  I would prefer not having a clamshell design; rather I would go for something more open and flexible. Also, only free activities should be hosted there.
* I think the amount of space allocated towards active recreational activities in Phase 1B is sufficient. I like that the active facilities are located together instead of scattered across the park. 
* As part of the overall active recreation features, a biking loop should be created along the Audrey Zapp Dr - Freedom Way - Morris Pesin Dr - Philip St for the ""active"" cyclists (think lycra) and to separate them from the other bike paths that would be used for more casual movement.  
* There is very little access to green space in Jersey City and Hudson County. Hence it is important to ensure that green spaces are prioritized in the design of the Park. The high volume of traffic in the park attests to the preference that people have for the current emphasis on passive recreation. 
* Future meetings of the Task Force should be broadcast live online. There is no need of public commentary at these meetings, but there should be transparency regarding its deliberations, especially given the apparent push to make material modifications to the existing plan.",3/2/2024 15:54,10.1.2.9

Why should local youth be exposed to these harmful substances?  As well, when this area does flood, all the crumb rubber and loose plastic grass blades are going straight into the estuary.

Instead, please consider setting up a program at Liberty State Park to train local youth in how to manage NATURAL GRASS for lawns and sports fields, how to care for trees, and how to maintain sustainable natural spaces.

,Maureen,,Crowley,,moher1@aol.com,"The first director of the National Park Service, Stephen Mather, envisioned both national and state parks as a great system containing “the highest potentialities of national pride, national contentment, and national health…A visit inspires love of country; begets contentment; engenders pride of possession; contains the antidote for national restlessness…”  

Liberty State Park speaks to Mather’s vision in many ways.  It’s not just that the site looks out at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, symbolizing core values and immigrant history to all visitors and to our city's diverse population. It’s also that the park to some extent balances the ceaseless building, fueled by the profit-motive, of the city around it, and of the city whose skyline is visible from it. It’s that the park was created and is sustained through grassroots people power. The preservation of Central Railroad terminal is a material reminder that we respect our architecture and our history. 

That history, however, should be recognized not only for its achievements, but for its ills,  starting with the displacement and erasure of indigenous peoples who once used the lands of LSP, and including the environmental degradation left behind by the railroads once their profits declined. The land restoration that has taken place in Liberty State Park gives us hope that we still have a collective ability to address our historical mistakes and injustices and maybe even have a chance to address overwhelming challenges like human-caused climate change.

The DEP has been leading a process to improve the park and balance interests. My own view is “less is more”-- that the park should not be used to satisfy the city’s needs for active recreation. If active recreation to the park, however, is added it should be explicitly acknowledged that it is not a precedent encouraging future incremental increases in active uses and more infrastructure. Instead, the goal for the park should be respect for the open land and water, for habitat and nature education, for providing rare opportunity for our children to be in touch with nature. It should be the primary responsibility of Jersey City and the developers seeking to build in the city to provide for the active recreational needs of our growing population and our children, and to address the needs of communities near LSP whose residents want more recreational opportunities. 
 
The future should not include an exclusionary Sports and Entertainment Complex or any other large-scale commercial uses.   Increased automotive traffic should be discouraged. Any added circulation paths should use permeable surfaces. Park entry should be and remain free. The park should not be viewed as a revenue-producer, but as the People’s Park, open and free to all.

,Nicole,,Greco,,nicolegreco.sml@gmail.com,"NJ's DEP, by its own definition, describes itself as an ""unfailing guardian of New Jersey's most precious natural and historic resources.""  

Mr. Fireman wants to turn LSP into the only product he knows how to sell- something for a youth-driven, entertainment-above-all-else, American stereotype. This entire thing reeks of ageism, classism and the outmoded capitalism that drove trees out of places like Jersey City in the first place. 

I ask the DEP to fulfill its duty to protect the state's natural and historic resources at this critical juncture. On the historic side, there's the Morris Canal.  The natural resources are too extensive to list.  Just following the line of thinking that  LSP is one of the most vulnerable salt marshes in the entire Hudson estuary- have environmental groups on the other side of the Hudson (and upriver) been invited to attend/comment/weigh in?  The boundaries of the estuary region include both NJ and NY. If Fireman's vision comes true, and he gets to replace entire swaths of greenspace with impervious surface, how would that not play into regional floodin

LSP was a gift to present and future generations by planners and taxpayers. The park, and subsequent remediations have been bought and paid for by taxpayers with the intent of creating greenspace access for all. It took decades to get the land to reach its environmental potential. Replacing it with concrete and other impervious surface is an enormous step  backward and will only benefit some for a finite period of time. The region is not short on recreational space- with two major arenas within 10 miles and world-class sports facilities available for contract and use at public institutions nearby.

Where is the proof? The need for preserving this space is well documented by not only the NJ DEP, the EPA but even the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gets it: their analysis of the Hudson River estuary concludes the following: ""The vulnerability of the entire area continues because of its desirability for development opportunity. Only comprehensive planning that recognizes the habitat values of this area, coupled with analyses of the impact to the habitat of individual proposals taken in the context of cumulative impacts, will result in balanced and effective protection of the estuary.

Where, then, is the scientifically proven, measured, monitored and cross-referenced demand for more recreation in Northeastern New Jersey? Access to all the proposed activities in Fireman's plan already exist, nearby, and are reachable via mass transit. Trading environmental resources for additional entertainment is a poor investment with decreased ROI in the face of climate change. It's bad economics, short-sighted planning and a disturbing example for younger generations. 

Although the plan is presented as a way to benefit today's youth, let's remember this, today's youth are in a mental health crisis. They worry about their future, their world. Pour concrete today, and it will take decades for them to restore LSP to its current glory.

LSP is for the people. This plan is for the age demographic with the most disposable income. One example: amphitheaters and arenas are not welcoming places for elderly or disabled people but the park is. There's no democratization when you replace flat, soft ground with multi-level concrete staircases.

The head of DEP, Shawn LaTourette, pushed back against concerns that the park would be commercialized, as many conservationists have long feared. In a call with reporters on Thursday morning, he said the plans don’t include any large-scale developments, like a large community center, entertainment venue or track and field stadium.

“Liberty State Park will never be a youth sports complex, Liberty State Park will be a park for the people that we will ensure is capable of meeting multiple ends,” LaTourette said.",3/2/2024 14:42,10.1.2.9

Investment in and preservation of open green space is one of the single best ways to ensure the long-term health of our community.

There is nothing like parks and open green space to preserve long term value to property, to retain residents, and to maintain the sense of identity and character that we all love about Jersey City. 

What would New York City be without Central Park, Riverside Park? What would Brooklyn be without Prospect Park? If instead of preserving parkland we had built stadiums where our National Parks now stand - Yellowstone, Yosemite, Acadia - in those days the profiteers wanted dams, oil wells, and mines. Gratefully open space was preserved and our nations greatest natural sites will be available for future generations. 

Liberty State Park is no different. This is one of our nation’s most important public spaces. We can’t get this wrong.

Jersey City has experienced rampant development that has not included important investments in green space. 

Should we build opportunities for youth activities? absolutely yes. But more out-of-control, for-profit development of one of Jersey City’s precious few open green spaces?  Definitely not. It’s not in the interest of our youth, not in the interest of our community now, or for generations to come.",3/2/2024 14:20,10.1.2.6

,Joann,,Brennan McKee,,jmcbmck@aol.com,"A park is a place of refuge, where people can go to experience nature and escape the pressures of daily life. It is not a football stadium, or a major concert venue, or a casino development, or a golf course. It cannot be used to fill the recreational void that is rightly the responsibility of Jersey City. Liberty State Park should be treated, as are other state parks, as primarily a place of respite.

A slowly growing trend in the U.S. is the acquisition and return to nature of golf courses, eliminating their environmental pollution and overuse of water. See the New York Times article of 2/15/24, entitled “After Shutting Down, These Golf Courses Went Wild.” This is an option that NJDEP should consider. Adding the current golf course space to the park would eliminate the pollution generated by the golf course and would provide additional space for active recreation without compromising the intrinsic nature of a state park. It would also eliminate the constant pressure from the golf course owner and his agents to privatize the park.

The NJDEP must not lose sight of its core mission by turning Liberty State Park into a commercial venture. The park is a precious resource and needs to be protected in perpetuity, because once it’s gone, it’s gone.",3/2/2024 13:56,10.1.2.5
,Becky,,Hoffman,,bhoffman45@comcast.net,"Thank you for  hosting this meeting on 3/2 in person at Liberty State Park and with the opportunity to participate via zoom and this comment box.  Please make sure the process continues to be OPEN and transparent.  Too much has been done behind closed doors that has increased misinformation and animosity when there is more in common than not.  However, the one area where there is extreme disagreement is on any efforts to privatize any part of the park - that cannot happen.  Liberty State Park needs to remain free and open to all.

I am a resident of Jersey City AND the State of New Jersey.  The City of Jersey City is primarily responsible for recreation spaces  and has failed the community in that respect.  That said, there is room for both recreation and open space in LSP. What is Not negotiable is turning over the park to private interests or creating a sports and entertainment complex as endorsed by those supported by Paul Fireman.  

The  vision of this  park as an oasis for our community and those in the state of NJ and that includes the proposed 60 acres of recreational space while protecting and restoring the wetlands is important. Finding the proper balance should be the role of this task force.

The commissioner mentioned hosting large events like fan events for the World Cup. While exceptions for unusual events like this should be allowed with proper permitting - this is NOT the general use of the park for the public on a daily basis.  It should be primarily for the residents of JC and New Jersey who need a respite from the challenges of urban life.

There's been a lot of discussion about active recreation in the park, specifically referring to adding more active recreation for residents of Bergen-Lafayette. Historically, diverse communities like Bergen-Lafayette have been excluded from nature activities (called the ""Nature Gap""). Pushing the rhetoric that active recreation is more important than passive enjoyment of nature is enforcing the Nature Gap, not working to end it. We should be focusing on making outdoor spaces welcoming to all, and a key part of that is ensuring that we have natural spaces at all that are close enough for people to visit regularly. Some active recreation at LSP is fine but no matter how much is added to the plans, more is pushed for. Passive recreation is also more inclusive to more people, as not everyone can participate in active recreation.",3/2/2024 13:52,10.1.2.5
,David,,Spence,,david@windigodesign.com,"Of the 4 options proposed for the phase 1B athletic hub at the north section, the one with tennis and basketball courts may work best for that area for several reasons:

1. This option does not create high amounts of traffic since their uses have a smaller amount of players and less potential for high amounts of spectators. Traffic at the Audrey Zapp entry point is already very congested.
2. Parking needs for these uses is much simpler to plan, and a better scale  
3. Existing Marina access and parking areas are maintained 
4. This option provides smaller areas of storm water runoff when compared to Astro turf fields 
5. They provide active recreational space for local residents.

Due to the size and width of regulation football/soccer fields/running track, the other options eliminate the marina parking and access to the docks which is not practical or a workable solution. These proposed uses also create high amounts of traffic and congestion for organized games and tournaments, and require a much higher degree of management and maintenance. 

Having said this, eliminating 2-3 BB courts would be a more appropriate ratio of developed vs natural space for this part of the park.

I look forward to seeing the direction of the design.

I believe the park can be improved and can provide active recreation as well as natural areas but making the park a sports and entertainment center is not what the natural park should be changed to - we have to protect the natural parts of the park. It is hard for me to trust the task force because it was appointed- so I don’t know who they are representing.

Liberty State Park is unparalleled as a masterpiece of our parks and natural areas. Whenever I go to Liberty State Park, I feel a deep sense of freedom, peace, and connection to nature. This is a feeling that never gets old - and never goes away. Exploring the different green spaces, observing the wildlife, relaxing on a bench or in the picnic areas, and walking along the waterfront, away from the noise and bustle of the city - these are treasured experiences that refresh and restore me.

Along with all of the individual activities - being in nature, running, and bicycling - available at Liberty State Park, families and groups can take advantage of the rich offerings of Liberty State Park’s playgrounds and picnic areas. Our grandkids, along with so many others, have celebrated wonderful birthday parties there.

I am encouraged by the development of a multi-stage plan for thoughtful development and enhancement of Liberty State Park. This plan shows that we can include active recreation in the park while keeping it as a wonderful public space.

In place of detailed comments related to the proposed design plans for the park, I want to underscore that I, along with many other local area residents, stand very much AGAINST large-scale commercialization and privatization in Liberty State Park, including stadiums and/or concert venues. 

Projects and facilities of this type have no logical place in the peaceful, natural environment of LSP. If these facilities were proposed for Central Park in Manhattan, there’s no question that these ideas would be summarily rejected. The same should be true for our precious local park. 

In addition, we need to fully protect the Caven Point Natural Area Migratory Bird Habitat and Nesting Area from demolition by Liberty National Golf Club.

Finally, moving forward, any future committees and/or task forces focused on LSP should include long-time community stakeholders currently excluded from its decision making committee, such as the Jersey City Parks Coalition, the Urban League of Hudson County, and statewide conservation organizations.

Liberty State Park should be maintained as a sanctuary where you can relax and decompress, it must stay resoundingly a natural environment in the dense urban area in which it is found.

,Henry,,Pullin,,hpullin11@gmail.com,"For decades Liberty State Park has provided people from Jersey City, from New Jersey, and from around the world with the opportunity to connect with nature, connect with the history of our region, and enjoy access to free open space in the middle of one of the most densely populated areas of the world. I believe that it is incredibly important to expand upon and enhance the resources that Liberty State Park currently provides and that the privatization and commercialization of areas of the park, such as the construction of a stadium and other private venues, should NOT occur. Access to free open space and natural areas is very limited in this area. The natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced allowing for more passive and free recreation. The proposed salt water marsh is an excellent example of expanding on and enhancing the open space in the park. Not only will areas like this enable people to connect with and learn about the natural world, they will provide for storm residency and create wildlife habitat. Natural areas should be enhanced and created and existing natural areas should be protected. This includes the Caven Point area, this is a vital natural area that provides habitat and the opportunity for education and passive recreation, it needs to be protected. 

This is not to say that opportunities for public active recreation should not be created. Fields and courts can be created in a concentrated manner in different parts of the park. A great example of a well designed active recreation facilities can be found at the Brooklyn Bridge Park in NYC. Larger fields can possibly be created but should be kept to a minimum. Limiting the uses of areas the park by building large active recreation fields is not fair to people who are looking use the park in a wider variety of ways. 

In summary, the park should be modeled after a Central Park style park, natural areas should be expanded on and enhanced and used as storm water infrastructure, and active recreation should be built but in concentrated areas and not at the expense of natural areas. Additionally, private venues and stadiums should absolutely not be built.

,David,,Burdzy,,burdzydave1@gmail.com,"I appreciate the idea of revitalizing Liberty State Park and bringing more opportunities to the community in enjoying their experience. As a born and raised member of Jersey City, I have seen many changes to the city in the past 20 years, which had both positive and negative effects on the community. Seeing these plans, I will say that I do not think adding athletic fields will benefit the park or the community. There are already a handful of city parks full of different sports courts and skateparks surrounding Liberty State Park where kids and teens may play and be active. The purpose of the STATE park is for it to be a conservation of the environment, allowing migratory birds to nest and have their own space. For people to get away from the bustle of the city and to be enveloped in nature. The inclusion of these sports facilities will take that experience away and increase noise pollution that might scare away the birds and other wildlife. It is said that the inclusion of these facilities will bring more people to the park but the park already has many families, runners, and birdwatchers that come causing the parking on the weekends to be full. If facilities are added, more parking space would be needed to be constructed. Remember, this park isn't large enough to include everything this plan wants and to still feel like a state park. Liberty State Park is 1/3rd of Central Park which is why it can include the facilities it has. Jersey City has enough city parks that include facilities which should have revitalizing as well. Add more green space to the city in general. 

I do happen to agree with the inclusion of a community center as long as it's not in any natural wetlands occupied by nature. The facility plans including a community garden and a classroom is important, it helps reach out to the community and our youth to teach about environmentalism and ecology which has a massive influence on our future and the planet's future. I also approve of the Train Shed at the Central Jersey Transit Station to be utilized into a walking space that mixes history and environment, with the inclusion of train cars, more community gardening and even the possibilities of composting or bee gardening. This applies to the amphitheatre space which has a natural design to it. As well as love the idea of art space throughout the park such as the rememberance grove. It would enhance the beauty of the park and allow local artists to reach the community and add a unique personality as well. 

As for the beach, I don't know how I feel about that as a piece of the state park. It doesn't feel right or natural. It clashes with the rest of the design. 

Finally my thoughts on the clean up of the part of the park that is considered the Habitat conservation is important as long as it is an environmental cleanup that is to remove any chemicals and hazards to the wildlife. But I'm not sure if the landscape should be changed physically to include trails if it impedes upon the bird sanctuary and disrupts their habitat. This includes the freshwater wetlands and tidal wetlands if it means bulldozing and creating those spaces, but if they already exist there naturally and left untouched, then it is fine. In the end, the bird sanctuary should be left untouched and far away from human interaction unless it's to the birds benefits, Caven Point included.

With one of the lowest green covers in the nation and losing substantially more trees than we plant each year to concrete development, we're setting ourselves up for increased heat absorption in the summers, making the city less resilient to future warming. Instead of further covering areas with concrete, let's maximize the space for trees, especially in Liberty State Park (LSP). A 2015 study by the Jersey City Environmental Commission found the city loses at least 126 trees annually despite planting efforts. This trend has only worsened, with recent reports indicating a decline in the tree canopy to less than 11%. Please see: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GI8Fu0VSo_C5puB6UHe5XX9VzhfX8xid/view and https://www.tapinto.net/towns/jersey-city/sections/green/articles/making-sure-trees-count-jersey-city-tree-census-shows-a-decline-in-canopy-cover

- There’s a reason “soccer moms” have minivans or SUVs.  When I take my family to a park or facility for something as short as a 2 hour soccer game, we bring snacks or meals, coolers of ice and water, shade umbrellas or canopy, folding seating or a ground cover, and a way to toilet my little ones.  Remote parking with a bus system makes my trip that much longer and more difficult to lug all that stuff from the car to the sidelines, and would reduce the number of trips we would make each year.

- necessary facilities for sports participants and spectators include fresh drinking water sources and bathrooms at the very least.  I don’t see these sideline facilities on the NAH plans.  If I’m not lugging outside food on the remote parking transfer bus, then I need to be able to buy these things at the field.  I don’t see snack stands or meal options, in fact you’ve even proposed taking away our favorite hotdog stand by liberty house restaurant. I don’t see bathrooms or water fountains.  Cramming the most fields you can fit into the space doesn’t make those fields usable.

I’m sorry, but JC just isn’t NYC yet.  Central Park has a huge and well established multimodal network of transportation options with connections at every park entrance.  Our HBLR doesn’t even connect to our PATH at more than two points, and neither of those seamlessly.   Our NJTransit buses are not nearly ubiquitous enough to support everyone who wants to access our parks, and inconvenient for families with young children and the supplies to keep them safe and happy for a day out.

,carrow,,thibault,,carrow@cthibaultarchitect.com,"The task force does not appear to have a coherent understanding of what the community needs or how to provide it. The plan is being driven by the desire of private individuals to build sports and concert venues for profit, from which revenues might be distributed to as yet unidentified future public facilities in the park. I am skeptical about how much money would be left for playing fields, tennis courts, skate parks or whatever, after operating costs and return on investment are covered. I agree with the point made that the DEP and task force need to come up with real data on needs of the community. It is important to determine how to pay for them- through grants, bonding, etc.- not through disruptive commercial facilities like a sports or concert arena which will generate too much traffic and the requirement for acres of parking (which will be empty most of the time) that would diminish the park's environment by creating more run-off and pollution.
Separate the two issues: 1. public amenities such as playing fields, areas for passive activities, education; and: 2. ticketed sports and concert venues with their huge negative impact on the park . I am certain the City can find ways to pay for public community recreational facilities through local, state and federal funding sources.

,Jaime,,Conheeney,,amortalidea@gmail.com,"I keep hearing ""let's get this done ASAP"" by some task force members as an excuse not to be exhaustive in planning and consulting the public and responding to their needs/concerns. However, I would like to point out that if the DEP valued efficiency, then why go with the ""lowest bidder"" for jobs? LSP's nature center took 9 years to reopen because of the lack of support, and also because the contractors were not skilled and did not care and were not being paid that much. The nature center was supposed to open in 2019 then 2020 and each time they were close, something would break and the team would have to fly out from Minnesota to fix it...It finally opened in 2021.

,Beth,,Daugherty,,btdaugh@gmail.com,"Commissioner LaTourette just stressed that State Policy has been changed to allow for an athletic hub to be developed and funded within a state park.  This is unprecedented and should be done correctly, even if it takes multiple years.  It is clear that the athletic fields in phase 1B are a stop gap measure to provide playing fields for JC residents until the more comprehensive Athletic Hub in the southern portion of LSP is complete. 

Please do not destroy the marina, an existing asset used by many NJ and Jersey City residents, in order to provide a short term solution for athletics that is riddled with problems.  Placing athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will make an already congested road unbearable and create an untenable shortage of parking for both current marina tenants and all those who hope to use the new fields.  

The intersection of Audrey Zapp and Philips/Jersey Ave has become very congested since the opening of the Jersey Ave bridge, and is already fairly dangerous for the volume of pedestrian and bike traffic that crosses this intersection to access LSP. Additional traffic volume due to those using the proposed athletic fields, combined with those trying to access the renovated Ferry building and Train Shed, will cause this intersection and Audrey Zapp Drive to come to a standstill.  

With over 500 boats in the marina, emergency vehicles, both fire and medical, need immediate and direct access to all of the docks in the marine.  This requires a wide paved area adjacent to the marina. The current tenant parking lot provides this access. 

Another safety aspect that is not reflected in the design is safety netting to prevent balls from going into the dock areas.  These nets would be a terrible eyesore and a danger to the numerous birds around the marina.

When considering alternative parking options for marina tenants, it is important to understand that marina tenants are typically bringing substantial gear and provisions to their boat which requires a car, not mass transit or shuttles.  Once delivering these items to their boat, they then need a guaranteed place to park - for the day, overnight, or for many nights, depending on how long they will be out on their boat.  

A thorough traffic and parking study should be completed during the summer before athletic fields are considered along Audrey Zapp Drive.  Parking needs to be designed and available before facilities are built which bring more traffic. While there are numerous parking lots throughout LSP and in JC just outside the park - they are often full. 

Another unintended consequence of placing the athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive will be undermining the success of the Jersey City New City Kids - summer City Sail program.  Over the years Liberty Yacht Club members, who are primarily tenants of the marina, have funded the City Sail paid intern positions for Jersey City high schoolers, funded new sails for the City Sail sailboat, volunteered to help teach the participants how to sail, and LYC members have taken the City Sail participants out on their own boats to increase the number of youth who can experience boating.  If marina tenant parking is greatly reduced, this will cause LYC to lose members who have been instrumental in supporting the City Sail program, potentially ending the sailing aspect of this unique summer program for Jersey City youth. 

If an Athletic Hub is a priority, please design and build it in a responsible way without decimating existing assets and causing a traffic nightmare for all.  Please do not build formal athletic fields along Audrey Zapp Drive.",3/2/2024 12:47,10.1.2.9
,Jason,,Renker,,jason1916@me.com,"Having listened to the entire public meeting, I was distressed by the feeling that Liberty State Park is seen as vacant land by many people who want to bite pieces off it in order to solve all the problems of Jersey City. What makes Liberty State Park special is the fact that much of it is NOT developed for high-traffic, high-density use. Furthermore, I was disturbed by the idea that sections of the park need to be developed to somehow act as a destination for people attending the 2026 World Cup, a one-time event that does NOT serve the needs of local residents.

Having said that, I am not against the development intended for Phase 1B—that area is a patchwork of development already. As long as the amphitheater is very low profile, low impact, and does not make the space useless for other activities, even that feature would be okay.

As for Phase 2, I oppose Phase 2A in its current incarnation. The Southern Athletics Hub is a massively overbuilt idea that, as I mention above, seems to simply give away park land to solve the problems with Jersey City. It would take a huge bite out of Liberty State Park's undeveloped area and make it a destination for concerts and sporting events. I am trying to think of other parks—Central Park, Golden Gate Park, Prospect Park, etc.—where such a concession would be granted. Rather than turning this corner of the park into the Meadlowlands sporting arena, the plans for development should be scaled way back.",3/2/2024 12:44,10.1.2.8

Fishing and going out of the marina is very important to the fishing community.

,Alexis,,O'Callahan,,alexisizzle@gmail.com,"I am an early-career ecologist born and raised in Hudson County. I also worked at Liberty State Park for a year as a naturalist. I understand that public participation is being solicited, but I am shocked by the calls for ""closed door sessions,"" the plans not being reviewed thoroughly before this meeting, there not being time for task force members to review the public feedback, and the ambiguity of the ""LSP Task Force"". I have a number of comments, all calling for more science and transparency in the design process.

1) Who assembled the task force, and how are you ensuring that this task force is representative of Jersey City and Hudson County stakeholders? Giving the public one comment per session while we listen to task force members sucking the air out of the room is amplifying-- not balancing--power imbalances.

2) I appreciate the commissioner's persistence in trying to consult the public/task force for driving the Revitalization Plan in terms of assessing needs. I think there needs to be a more strategic, systematic approach for assessing community needs, though. Just because someone on the task force or of the public has an interest in Jersey City, does not mean they represent the community's interests (who wouldn't have an interest in one of the greatest parks in one of the greatest cities?). I think conducting social science and geographic research would help minimize biases and those taking advantage of their positions of power/influence to make this Plan into something profitable for themselves. Such studies are done by NYC Parks, e.g. their Social Assessment Surveys, where parks staff interview park users, record where they are in the park, some demographic info (residence etc), and inquire about green space meaning and their needs. This allows the natural resource scientists to track park density and use based on features (e.g. how dense ballfields are vs. bike paths). By analyzing existing use and collecting real data from those who USE the park, you are broadening your stakeholder population and getting a more accurate picture (though this needs to be done across the year).

3) I also think there needs to be a greater geographic scope of assessing needs to identify the uses of existing neighborhood parks & ballfields to track where exactly in the city there is the greatest need. Turning LSP into the ""one size fits all"" for active recreation ignores the fact that this is an unlimited resource. Certain teams/orgs/folks will use the active spaces more than others. There needs to be a more concerted collaboration between the youth sports organizations to ensure this space meets the needs of those who need it, rather than one spokesperson claiming that building more ballfields will solve inequities across the city....

4) There needs to be more transparency about the consultants taking our feedback into their designs and transparency in general about why the designers picked what they did & what studies they're conducting to ensure LSP is fit for their designs. 

5) I would like to see hydrological mapping and climate change scenarios research done for the park before revitalizing it to establish baselines and identify vulnerabilities. The freshwater marsh in the back of the Nature Center was inundated by Hurricane Sandy and became a brackish pond-- meaning the restoration was a failure. How will you ensure that the positioning and capacity of the ""nature based solutions"" will be enough to meet our needs in the face of climate change? I hear there is reluctance to accommodate gray design (retention basins) and the response that we have ""so much nature based solutions"" we don't need retention basins, but look at NYC and remember Sandy? What data are we making these judgments from? 

6) Also, I don't see hydrology mentioned at all. When altering the topography and terrain with amphitheatres, etc, how are you sure this will not negatively lead to stormwater runoff or unanticipated flooding of park areas? Are there other green infrastructure elements you are considering? Why not permeable pavement and permeable basketball courts? etc. Make a space multifunctional.

7) I would like to see habitat quality and biodiversity studies informed by projected increases of use, density, and traffic.

8) How are you going to ensure the restoration projects are maintained? So many restoration projects are started, but do not receive funding to ensure they are successful. The park staff is microscopic and underpaid, yet this is the highest revenue-generating park. How are you ensuring the longevity and sustainability of this work from an organizational stand point?",3/2/2024 12:39,10.1.2.4

,Ashley,,Metius,,ashleymetius@gmail.com,"It's imperative that the new design of Liberty State Park prioritizes serious coastal tidal wetland creation and restoration, while effectively addressing climate change, enhancing resiliency, and protecting critical habitats in this prime location of Jersey City. Due to decades of urbanization, pollution, and habitat degradation, these wetlands have been severely impacted, jeopardizing their ability to function effectively as natural buffers against climate change and sea-level rise. Moreover, the loss of these wetlands has resulted in the decline of essential wildlife populations and compromised the overall health of our coastal ecosystems. By incorporating citizen science and engaging Jersey City schools, we can transform this future restored habitat into an invaluable outdoor classroom, fostering environmental education and instilling a sense of stewardship among our youth.

This project presents a unique opportunity to showcase smart design principles in a flagship state park, demonstrating how sustainable practices can harmonize with nature while meeting the needs of our community. Implementing third-party sustainable rating systems (i.e., Envision, WEDG, LEED) throughout the design and construction processes will ensure that the highest standards of environmental responsibility are upheld, setting a precedent for future development projects.

,Caroline,,Parks,,Guitarcookie15@yahoo.com,"I, as well as my friends and neighbors are disappointed and concerned about Paul Fireman and Bob Hurley’s repeated attempts to put a “sports and entertainment complex” and “5000 seat football stadium and 7000 seat commercial concert venue in the park” as quoted in the Jersey Journal, and the JC Times reported that Hurley now wants to increase active recreation from 60 to 85 acres.

Liberty State Park is one of the reasons I moved to Jersey City. It’s so nice there, very nice to see families picnicking in the grass, walking the length of the park. I can’t imagine how awful a huge ugly sports stadium would blot out the sky, like a huge eyesore. Or the parking mess it would create.

,Jill,,Scipione,,jbscipione@gmail.com,"County parks are being filled with sports fields of artificial turf. Please consider not using these for Liberty State Park. As these artificial fields are flammable they spend much of the time locked up and inaccessible. No one can use them informally.There are no pick up games. There is zero use for the general public. This is highly inappropriate for a State park..

More importantly, artificial turf has many unacceptable and known environmental problems. These are a few from several articles on the subject(I apologize as I am not sure how to include the links):

Artificial turf lasts for eight to 10 years, after which it is typically disposed of in a landfill

Artificial turf does not eliminate the need for water; in some cases, it is irrigated with water in order to temporarily bring down high surface temperatures. 

Maintenance can include treatment with antimicrobials, as well as periodic addition of infill to replace the infill that migrates off the field into the environment.On top of the chemical makeup of artificial turf, it is also impermeable (unlike natural grass). It requires harsh chemicals for cleaning sweat, mucus, spit, blood, bird droppings, etc., that remain on the surface.

 A recent article in Architectural Digest notes that artificial turf’s plastic material “traps heat during the day and holds it through the night, meaning runoff water will leave turf hotter than it would natural grass” - which can have negative effects on aquatic ecology. 

In sunny, warm weather, artificial turf can become much hotter than natural grass, raising concerns of heat-related illness and skin burns for athletes playing on the fields.

While natural grass absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen, artificial turf does the opposite by releasing CO2, methane, and a variety of chemicals. Chemical analysis of artificial turf conducted at Yale University found 96 chemicals, 20 percent of them probable carcinogens. In addition, artificial turf contains highly toxic PFAS or “forever chemicals” linked to lower childhood immunity, endocrine disruption and cancer. Children are especially vulnerable to inhalation, ingestion and dermal absorption, as they are lower to the ground and breathe more quickly.

After years of blowback from parents and environmentalists, some companies are now advertising artificial turf made with “natural infill.” But beware of these greenwashing tactics! These so-called “natural/organic” infills are typically made from silica sand coated with acrylic polymers. These pellets can easily break down into hazardous silica dust – a lung hazard recognized by the EPA as a carcinogen. This is also combined with the breaking down of the acrylic polymer coating into plastic dust and micro-debris. Some “natural” infills are made from cork and coconut, which can easily flake and blow away, leaving a dangerously hard playing surface.

On top of that, no matter how “natural” the infill may be, the plastic green blades that act as “grass” remain a serious environmental and health concern.

As the DEP you are obligated to not further pollute our environment, especially  in a park of all things. And we count on you to also ensure anything that encompasses so many acres that is sited in a state park is usable by the public, not just Jersey City and Hudson County schools and organized teams.

We don't need more impermeable surfaces (buildings and parking lots). Also it's a completely cynical argument to say the local community needs more facilities and to propose a private sports and entertainment complex that charges admission fees and will not program to local interests.

These proposed developments would cause devastating harm to the park:
1) Disruption of Wildlife:  Increased traffic and noise pollution would severely impact bird populations, including critical migratory routes, and other resident wildlife.
2) Loss of Public Access:   The influx of traffic and crowds will deter the very residents LSP is meant to serve. Those seeking tranquility and nature immersion will be driven away.
3) Missed Opportunities:  The county has countless alternative locations, such as repurposed warehouses, that would allow these venues to thrive without compromising LSP's ecological integrity.

,Shlomit,,Geisler,,shulamit72000@yahoo.com,"As a senior I agree that Liberty State Park requires more shade and shelter from the sun.
It is vey difficult to walk there during the summer afternoons.
I suggest planting more trees which could partially solve this issue.

I also think that parking in all areas should be free and accessible to all in the Park.

The Park should retain its' natural beauty and peacefulness as you plan to develop and add recreation and sports space.
There needs to be a balance of  'quiet' space with 'active' space.
We need to  respect and maintain the greatest asset of the park which is  its' sanctuary spirit.

The potential is great for upgrading the park but keep in mind that park space should also be dedicated to honor our need for seeking peace within nature.
My concern is that the park will become very crowded and noisy and we don't want that to happen.

So let's try to think of ways to balance the 'quiet' with the 'more active' space.
Let's keep all the space in the park 'safe'.
There are areas by the behind the nature center where I do not walk because the bushes there are very high and I cannot see much in front of me.

Thank you.

The park needs to remain open and lush and full of free recreational areas for the public. The plans in 1A and 1B support this vision and will provide the neighborhood with improvements to our existing space.

However, allowing a private facility like Fireman proposes to become reality goes against the spirit of a public park. It would completely destroy the community aspect of a park that serves Jersey City.

,Karen,,Zavian,,kzav@comcast.net,"Liberty State Park is a successful space where people come to see, hear, touch, and generally experience all aspects of nature at their leisure.  Any additional athletic and entertainment facilities should only be considered for OUTSIDE LSP limits.  LSP’s purpose has already been defined!  It is the ONLY FREE OPEN AND GREEN SPACE in Jersey City!  It was created for that purpose!  LSP’s precious GREEN OPEN SPACE is its distinction.  It is a gift we have given our citizens and children.  More important than carving up LSP for ball fields, concert venues and other such stadium like facilities, OPEN GREEN SPACE, and the freedoms it engenders, is the most VITAL offering we must continue to maintain!  Constructing in LSP in order to make use of its resources is destroying its resources!  Peace of mind, growth of spirit, creativity, works produced by human creative skill and imagination, and health….   You don’t know what will be lost or destroyed on both physical and individual levels by filling in the green space with STUFF others are now deeming important and necessary!  

I also ask WHY MUST A STATE PARK take over the City's responsibility to provide/develop athletic and other entertainment facilities for its community.  DEFICITS??? 
  
 Why doesn't private wealthy influencer (Paul Fireman and his paid non-profit group) extend his own funds to develop what he is promoting and deeming imperative to the community?!",3/2/2024 12:20,10.1.2.5
,Moriah,,Kinberg,,moriahkinberg@gmail.com,"Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments. A few questions came up for me.

Has a study been done to actually assess the need for recreational space and athletics?  I would suggest actually doing a study to determine the need for athletics before spending billions to implement these fields. There is a football field ""Saint Peter's Prep James F. Keenan, S.J. Field"" next to the park. Was this considered? 

There is another full size football field in Washington Park that was built less than ten years ago and is not well utilized just to name a few. Washington Park is a County park and the football field may not be considered as a field that is available for use by JC students. I would look into this to see if the fields in County parks are accessible to all students in the County. They should be but that needs to be explored. 

We also have an ice skate rink and skating rink in Pershing Field that needs to be repaired. We also have several city parks that are filled with ball parks that are locked and not accessible to the public. 

Additional recommendations: 

1.) Incorporate public transportation into the park and more accessibility. Make the park by design as much as possible less reliant to cars. Pedestrian oriented.

2.) I support the use of all fields that are built out for stormwater management. It is needed and will also assist with addressing stormwater issues. 

3.) Support the nature based amphitheater 

4.) I also support understanding the existing uses of the park and expanding and facilitating the existing. 

5.) Keep as much of the existing plantings and trees and plant more trees and new gardens.  Are there any plans for new plantings, trees, art and nature installations? 

I support the proposed Phase 1 project. Using nature-based solutions to address flooding issues. We need nature based solutions to flooding. This project is a solution to flooding. I am not supportive of the additional athletics with out a study that shows the need based on the number of JC students who play these sports and the existing athletic fields. 

Phase 2

I agree with as much open space and multi-use as possible, especially given that we have several football fields in the City and surrounding areas. 

I do not support locked facilities that privatize the park and limit the use for everyone. 

The needs of the community are not limited to athletics. Jersey City has a recreation department and many opportunities and facilities for sports. This does not mean that there isn't a need but that need can be quantified and decisions should be based on data that includes existing facilities in City and County parks, schools and recreation areas. 

For the Jersey City community that I am a part of, one of the things that we lack is open green spaces. I personally utilize Liberty State Park as a refuge from the built environment that surrounds us. 

There is a massive need for open green space within an extremely built out city. Children in Jersey City need access to nature, open space to play safely, to fly kites, learn how to ride a bike in a space without cars. Areas that are free from development while our city continues to get built out. 

My biggest priority is actually maintaining as much open green space as possible, given the environmental and community benefits. 

I would also suggest making the park more accessible for public transportation and to design the park to be public transit and pedestrian oriented and less car oriented given the environmental benefits of encouraging public transportation. 

There is a lot of talk about bringing additional amenities for the park, like restaurants and food vendors. I would also encourage a study to ensure the economic viability of having additional year-round restaurants. And also suggest a way to encourage people who visit the park to also visit near by areas of Jersey City and for the for the economic benefits to spill over into Jersey City rather than be contained in the park. 

The amphitheater options without bandshell that would obscure the view looks good. Would need to consider accessibility. I would also encourage art installations to go along with the bandshell and other ways to engage with the natural environment. Gardens would be another way to utilize the park and the natural environment.",3/2/2024 12:17,10.1.2.5

,Joseph,,Albanese,,president@thehrfa.org,"Re: Proposed Privatization of Public Lands at Liberty State Park
I am the public access chairperson for both the Berkeley Strip Club (BSC) and the New Jersey Beach Buggy Association (NJBBA). We are two active groups of anglers from all over New Jerey and support the public’s right to access tidal waterways and their shores anywhere in NJ. We wholeheartedly agree with NJDEP when they say, “The Public Trust Doctrine is the principle that certain resources, in this case tidal waters and shorelines, are preserved for public use, and that the government is required to maintain them for the public's reasonable use.” (NJDEP website, Public Trust Doctrine Ensures Access). This right to access tidal waterways and their shores includes the Liberty State Park shoreline at the Hudson River.
Hudson County is the most densely populated county in New Jersey, and the sixth most densely populated county in the US. It has a population density of 15,961 people per square mile (2020 census). That makes Liberty State Park a recreational oasis for residents in the surrounding areas. While not as fully developed as New York’s Central Park, Liberty State Park is just as unique a greenspace. The views in the park include the NJ Turnpike to the west and an industrial park to the south but turn east and you are greeted with unparalleled views of the Hudson River, the New York Skyline, New York Harbor, and the Statue of Liberty. Where else in NJ do you have open public space with as spectacular a view as that?
The boundaries of Liberty State Park are finite and constrained by the development surrounding it. To take any portion of the park and privatize it is a desecration of the park. Public land taken for private use places that land off-limits to park users except for an elite few. That’s not why Liberty State Park was created. It was meant for everyone to enjoy.
Privatization will also block access to the shoreline of the Hudson River. That violates New Jersey’s long-standing commitment to the public trust. Access for the public not only includes visual access, but also requires both perpendicular access to the water’s edge and parallel access along the shoreline. Using that shoreline access allows the public to walk, fish, sit, or simply stand to enjoy the view. Building private marinas or venue space permanently eliminates public access.
Sports fields, passive recreation areas, picnic areas, and improved access for fishing should be what matters. Not privatization through development that would deny the public access.
It is also important to point out that the Hudson River is second only to Chesapeake Bay as a spawning ground for striped bass. Stripers are anadromous, meaning they live their adult life in saltwater but spawn in freshwater including the Hudson River as far north as Troy, NY. As those fish enter and exit the Hudson during the spring and fall runs, they swim along the New Jersey shore of the river and can be caught from the shore or piers extending into the river.
People fish not just for the chance to catch a striped bass, a true pelagic predator, but they catch stripers to feed their families. Any reduced fishing access, literally, takes food off people’s tables. The state needs to increase fishing access at Liberty State Park to better serve the needs of local residents.
Senator Scutari and Assemblyman Coughlin both represent areas with high population densities and highly industrialized areas along the Arthur Kill, portions of Raritan Bay and the Raritan River. Both Raritan Bay and the Raritan River are well known fisheries among anglers. I would think both the Senator and the Assemblyman would look to improve and expand access to tidal waterways in their respective districts instead of looking to take away access at Liberty State Park.

Liberty State a park should not become a massive entertainment complex. Active recreation has its value and is provided for in the DEP plan. But Liberty State Park is vital as a place where people of all ages and all income levels can engage in interactive recreation - walking, birding, nature hikes, picnicking, and more. I have personally led students on bird walks and nature hikes, and seen their interest blossom in ecology and conservation.  Not all young people play team sports. Not all who do play sports would even benefit from a stadium such as the one proposed by Bob Hurley and his ilk. Liberty State Park is vital for the hundreds of bird species (documented on eBird) and other wildlife who live in and travel through the park. But it is also vital for the humans who benefit from it and rely on it for their physical, mental, and emotional well-being.

,Gregg,,Lehmberg,,woodcraftergregg@aol.com,"I’m writing to express my deep concern regarding the plan to develop artificial turf (a.k.a. plastic grass) athletic fields in Liberty State Park rather than using natural grass surfaces. The issues with plastic grass are numerous, despite the natural appearance of the plastic carpet.

Climate Change

Plastic grass is primarily produced from the fossil fuel ethane which is extracted from the earth via fracking. The fracking process itself releases methane and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and pollutes ground water and soil.

Plastic grass contributes to climate change by off-gassing carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases in perpetuity once they are produced. Surfaces that are blanketed in plastic grass form heat islands by absorbing radiation from the sun and get as least as hot as asphalt with temperatures often exceeding 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

Simultaneously, these plastic surfaces replace a natural grass ecosystem which acts as a carbon sequestration system, pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere rather than adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Natural grass surfaces also remain cool during hot weather compared to the blistering hot temperatures of plastic grass surfaces.

Health Implications

The plastic grass blades contain many toxic chemical additives including plasticizers, dyes, heavy metals, and Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS). These materials are known and suspected carcinogens, toxins, endocrine disrupting compounds and respiratory irritants.

The infill used to keep the blades of grass propped up is most commonly crumb rubber produced from used tires. The crumb rubber contains an even greater number of toxic substances including volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heavy metals. The pungent smell coming off these fields on even a mild day is adequate proof that the local environment is being polluted with these toxic gases.

The immune systems of children and adolescents are not fully developed, making them more susceptible to negative health outcomes from exposures to these chemicals. Higher risk of dehydration and heat exhaustion from the excessive temperatures mentioned previously is an additional health concern.
It is well documented that there is an elevated risk of certain non-contact lower body injuries on artificial turf as well. This has been highlighted by several high-profile injuries in professional football in recent years.

Environmental Contamination

Typical fields consist of tens of thousands of pounds of plastic carpet and hundreds of thousands of pounds of infill, usually crumb rubber made from used tires. These materials break down and thousands of pounds migrate into the local environment each year, contaminating soil and water with toxic chemicals and micro plastic pollution. The carpet and infill only last about 10 years and there are currently no recycling facilities to deal with these materials. Inevitably, they end up in landfills or are incinerated. Either destination leads to further climate, environmental, and health impacts.

This is just a sampling of the issues related to plastic grass and would seem to be in direct opposition to the NJDEP’s Green Acres mission of ‘preserving and enhancing NJ’s natural environment’.

Cost of Ownership
There is one final point that I think is highly relevant and that is one of cost. The total cost of ownership for plastic grass is typically two to three times higher than natural grass fields, even when considering the added cost of an athletic field manager and proper organic maintenance.

Natural grass athletic fields designed for sports activity and maintained organically by an experienced athletic field manager can offer safe, durable playing surfaces without the negative aspects of artificial turf highlighted above.  New Jersey cannot afford to sacrifice any more natural space to these toxic plastic fields. The Climate, Health, and Environmental impact are too significant to justify their proliferation.",3/2/2024 11:15,10.1.2.4

The fields would be better in the CENTER vs the edge would be better because:

1. Ball sports are difficult in the WIND. That area on the water is very windy.
2. The current proposals do not have enough room for regulation fields.
3. The lights will be horrible from waterfront view (City / Brooklyn views etc). 
4. Interior placement seems like a more logical choice than prime waterfront placement.
5. Kids and boats/marinas don't mix well (hazard). Sufficient fencing would be needed.

My got into the zoom so that I could hear on my phone and that worked a little bit but then I got cut off and when I try to get back in it says I am on hold and the host is waiting to let me in.

These proposals are outrageous, as is the silence of many any government who need the money from the farmland other developers or at least they think they do.

Worse the community in the neighborhoods around Liberty State Park are being deceived.  As we watch high-rise towers rise all over the city and neighborhoods fall, it should be clear to those in this neighborhood that theirs will be next. 

You should all be working together for the public. Good b instead of being played against each other to nobody's benefit, except those who want to build these enormous for profit projects.

Ask fireman supporters when was the last time they went to an arena show or a sports stadium and paid the 75 to $100 entry and then $20 for a beer or $15 for a soda $10 for a hot dog?
When was the last time they did that and do they want to do that?  If the billionaire developers want these billion dollar projects why don't they spend their billions of dollars buying some land and putting them there.    The public is being divided to misinformation and we should all be working together to make liberty State Park the best that it can be.

And no matter what, the feedback and no matter what supposedly changes are agreed to at a meeting, firemen will always come back with the same requests... But asking more the Donald Trump's strategy and it's all people now anymore.

Thanks to those on the committee who have worked hard to understand and deal with very complicated issues.   That is sad that even your best intentions will not matter because in the end the underlying truth is that Fireman and the billionaires get what fireman and the billionaires want.

While I understand the need for some athletic fields it’s important to note that these fields would only be used seasonally while trails, bike paths, and the great views of LSP can be enjoyed year-round.  
I think we are selling our community and youth short by pretending that more limited use fields and indoor stadiums will somehow serve them better.  Many residents already treasure LSP and the DEP’s proposal and more programming will only enhance that while also brining new people to this really special urban park.",3/2/2024 10:17,10.1.2.6
,Dana,,Patton,,danampatton@gmail.com,"I have lived near the park for 20 years. We use the park daily. I am very concerned with the continued push to try to get privatized ventures into the park. Our area needs greenspace desperately. We have a turnpike running right by us that is planning to expand. Our neighborhood can flood and the park helps mitigate that. I love the plans to expand the parts of the park that are currently not accessible to the public. I love active recreation where there are currently parking lots in between marina and restaurants. I love walkways over marsh and other natural land. I love ideas to get people into all parts of the park that are not parking, such as trolleys, shuttles, bicycle parting. 
No other parks are expected to turn a profit or give up space to private ventures, and I don't know why that keeps being pushed in our state park.",3/2/2024 10:17,10.1.2.4
,Judith,,Weis,,jweis@newark.rutgers.edu,"The park should be used for active and passive recreation, fields for pick-up sports (baseball, tennis etc.), enjoying nature, open space, bird and wildlife watching, waterfront recreation and so forth. It should NOT be used of commercial sports events with stadiums or arenas. It would be wonderful for class field trips for schools at all levels for learning about nature on land and in the water. I repeat - not for commercial sports events!",3/2/2024 10:17,10.1.2.9
